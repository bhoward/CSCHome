<h2>BMV Specification</h2>

	
		
<p>
			[Some of this information comes from
			<a href="http://www.dmv.org/in-indiana/department-motor-vehicles.php">
			<code>DMV.ORG</code></a>, with appropriate simplifications.  Please
			do not use this page as an authoritative reference on the Indiana BMV.]
		</p>

		
<p>
			The Indiana Bureau of Motor Vehicles (BMV) issues vehicle
			registrations and titles in the state, as well as maintains
			the official vehicle ownership and registration records in
			Indiana. Besides establishing the legally registered owner
			during the sale of a vehicle, the Indiana BMV also takes on
			the responsibility of regulating and issuing the decals, or
			plates, that prove that an Indiana vehicle's registration and
			paperwork are current.
		</p>
		
		
<p>
			Within 60 days of moving to Indiana, you must have your vehicle
			titled and registered. If you purchase a new or used vehicle, you
			have 31 days from the date of purchase to title and register it.
		</p>
		
		
<p>
			To title a new vehicle, you must provide the Manufacturer's Certificate
			of Origin (MCO), a bill of sale, and verification of your Social Security
			number.  To title a used vehicle, you must provide a properly assigned
			certificate of title, a bill of sale, and verification of your Social
			Security number.  The MCO or the existing title should show the
			Vehicle Identification Number (VIN).  The fee for a new title is $9.
		</p>
		
		
<p>
			To register a vehicle, after obtaining a new title, you will also need
			proof of insurance.  The registration fee depends on the vehicle's current
			value, which is determined based on its year, make, and model. Your
			registration is valid for one year. The  month of expiration is based on
			the first two letters of your last name.
		</p>
		
		
<p>
			When you first register your vehicle, you will be assigned a license
			plate.  Each year, you will also receive a decal to be affixed to the
			plate which indicates your registration's expiration date.  Instead of
			the standard plate, you may choose a special recognition plate or a
			personalized plate.  A special recognition plate carries a $15
			administrative fee, and may also require an additional fee and
			authorization form depending on the recognized organization.  A special
			recognition plate may be personalized as well.
		</p>
		
		
<p>
			A personalized plate costs $48 annually.  You may choose any sequence of
			up to seven letters and numerals, plus at most one space, subject to
			availability and approval by the state.  You may apply for a personalized
			plate at any time, but you will not receive your plate until April of the
			following year.  The expiration date for all personalized plates is in
			April.
