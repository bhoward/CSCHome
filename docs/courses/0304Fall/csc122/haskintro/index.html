<P>
Haskell is a modern ``purely functional'' programming language.  A
functional language is one in which functions are as easy to manipulate as
the more common kinds of values, such as numbers and strings.  By being
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">purely</SPAN> functional, Haskell does not allow the operations
which make functions difficult to work with in traditional imperative
languages: assignment to global variables or reference parameters.  As a
result, calling a function will not have any ``side-effects''--that is, it
will not change the values of any non-local variables--and we are free to
treat them as pure functions (Carrano &amp; Prichard refer to these as ``valued
functions'' in Chapter 1 of our text).

<P>
As a higher-level language than C++ or Java, Haskell enables programmers
to be more productive and write shorter, clearer, and more maintanable
code.  Unfortunately, industry practice has not yet embraced functional
programming, in part because of the enormous effort it would take to
retrain current programmers and redesign all the support tools.  There
are signs that the industry will gradually move to higher-level
languages: for example, the next version of Java will contain several
new language features influenced by the design of Haskell.  In the
meantime, we will study Haskell because it provides a convenient and
safe (you will appreciate this safety when we talk about pointers in
C++) setting in which to explore recursive functions and data structures.

<P>
Here is an example of Haskell<A NAME="tex2html1"
  HREF="#foot28"><SUP><SPAN CLASS="arabic">1</SPAN></SUP></A> code to perform the recursive Mergesort
described in class:
<PRE>
merge([ ], ys) = ys
merge(xs, [ ]) = xs
merge([x:xs], [y:ys]) = if x &lt;= y
                        then [ x : merge(xs, [y:ys]) ]
                        else [ y : merge([x:xs], ys) ]

mergesort([ ]) = [ ]
mergesort([x]) = [x]
mergesort(xs)  = let (as, bs) = splitAt(length(xs) # 2, xs)
                 in merge(mergesort(as), mergesort(bs))
</PRE>
After defining these two functions, <code>merge</code> and <code>mergesort</code>,
one can sort a list by entering a command such as
<code>mergesort([3,1,4,1,5,9,2,6,5])</code>; the result is quickly printed:
<code>[1,1,2,3,4,5,5,6,9]</code>.

<P>
Even without knowing any details yet of the syntax of Haskell, it
should be easy to recognize the structure of Mergesort in this code.
The <code>mergesort</code> function is specified by three rules; the first two
handle the base cases of an empty list or a one-element list, while the
third rule handles the recursive case by splitting the data into two
halves, calling <code>mergesort</code> on each half, and then merging the
results with <code>merge</code>.  The <code>merge</code> function is also pretty
easy to read:  if either of the lists to be merged is empty, then it
just returns the other list (first two rules), otherwise it chooses the
smaller of the two first elements and puts it first in the result,
followed by another call to <code>merge</code> on the remainder of the data.
Compare this to the one-and-a-half pages of code used for a C++ version
of Mergesort in Chapter 9 of Carrano &amp; Prichard (which only works on
arrays of data up to a fixed maximum size--we will see a way around
this in Chapter 4, but it adds several more lines to the code), and you
will appreciate the power of higher-level programming provided by
Haskell.

<P>
There are several points to observe about the Mergesort program as we
start to learn the details of Haskell.  First, the program is organized
as a sequence of equations defining the functions.  Unlike the assignment
statement in C++, these are truly meant to be read as equations.  This
means that the familiar sort of algebraic reasoning by ``substituting
equals for equals'' will work for Haskell programs.  For example,
consider the following definition of the factorial function:
<PRE>
factorial(0) = 1
factorial(n) = n * factorial(n-1)
</PRE>
(You are encouraged to try this now in Funnie, as described in class and in
the companion handout.) We may evaluate the result of <code>factorial(4)</code>
by using the equations to expand the expression as follows:
<PRE>
factorial(4) = 4 * factorial(4-1)
             = 4 * factorial(3)
             = 4 * 3 * factorial(2)
             = 4 * 3 * 2 * factorial(1)
             = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 * factorial(0)
             = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 * 1
             = 24
</PRE>
In Funnie, you may open a ``Stepper Window'' to see this sequence of
expansions.

<P>
The second point to observe is that the computer will choose the first
equation that matches the arguments in a particular function call.  That
is, when it evaluates <code>factorial(0)</code>, it uses the first equation
rather than trying to evaluate <code>0 * factorial(-1)</code>.  This means
that we will usually want to handle the special ``base'' case(s) of
functions first in our programs, followed by the general recursive case.

<P>
Another observation about the Mergesort program is that it works on
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">lists</SPAN> of data, rather than the arrays common in C++.  Tied as it is to a
specific layout in memory (and the corresponding convention of avoiding
copying that block of memory by passing arrays by reference, which we
have already seen is a no-no in a purely functional language), the array
is too low-level a data structure for ordinary use in Haskell.  As we
will see starting in Chapter 3 of Carrano &amp; Prichard, switching to the
more abstract concept of a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">list</SPAN> of data allows an additional
level of flexibility in our programming.  Here are the operations on
lists that we need for Mergesort:

<UL>
<LI>Picking off the first element (the ``head'') of a list.  This is commonly
performed by matching a function argument against a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">pattern</SPAN> such
as <code>[x:xs]</code>--read this as matching a list composed of the first element
<code>x</code> followed by the remainder of the list (the other
``<code>x</code>'s'').  If you need to grab the first element of a list in an
expression without introducing a new function to use pattern-matching,
the <code>head</code> function will do the job:  <code>head([1,2,3])</code> is
<code>1</code>.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Adding a new element at the head of a list.  As suggested by the
pattern form above, this uses the colon (<code>:</code>) notation.  Therefore,
<code>[1 : [2,3]]</code> is the list <code>[1,2,3]</code>.  Note the asymmetrical
nature of this operation: the left operand is a single value, while the
right operand is a list of values.  If you want to concatenate two lists
together, use the <code>++</code> operator: <code>[1,2] ++ [3,4]</code> produces
<code>[1,2,3,4]</code>.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Constructing an empty list or a single-element list.  The empty
list is written <code>[ ]</code>, while a list consisting of just the value
<code>x</code> is written <code>[x]</code>.  As we have seen, this notation extends
to arbitrarily long lists by putting a comma-separated list of values
between the brackets.  This is all an abbreviation; what the computer is
really thinking when you write <code>[1,2,3]</code> is
<code>[1 : [2 : [3 : [ ]]]]</code>--that is, start with the empty list and
successively prepend the values <code>3</code>, then <code>2</code>, and finally
<code>1</code> at the head.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Getting the length of a list and splitting it into two sublists.
These operations are not directly built into the language, but rather
are provided as part of the ``Standard Prelude'' of commonly used
functions (think of the common functions defined in C++ headers such as
<code>&lt;iostream&gt;</code> or <code>&lt;string&gt;</code>).  We could write these functions
ourselves--for example, here is a definition of <code>length</code>:
<PRE>
length([ ]) = 0
length([x:xs]) = 1 + length(xs)
</PRE>
--but they are used so frequently that people have assembled a standard
collection of functions that are always available (without even needing
the equivalent of a <code>#include</code>...).
