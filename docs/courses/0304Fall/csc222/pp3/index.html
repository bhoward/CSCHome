<P>
This project will be due by 5 pm, Friday, October 31.  To submit your
project, save it in the <code>pp3</code> directory located in your directory under
<code>/home/libs/dataStr/students/</code> on one of the department's Linux
machines (this is a shared directory, so you should be able to reach it
from any of the machines, including Jupiter).

<P>
You may work on this project by yourself or in a group of two or three.
If you work in a group, be sure to include everyone's name in the
comments at the top of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">each</SPAN> file.  Also, be sure you understand
the guidelines for group work listed in the syllabus--the fundamental
idea is that everyone in the group should understand what everyone else
has done, and be able to recreate it on their own.

<P>
The project is to create a program that can manage a simple family tree.
The operations you will need to support are: reading the tree from a
file, displaying the tree on the screen, and querying family
relationships in the tree.  Each of these will be described in more
detail below.

<P>
The simplified family tree we will work with is in fact a binary tree
(surprise!).  Therefore, each person has at most two children, and each
child has only one parent.  For the rest of this handout, consider the
following example:

<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<IMG
 WIDTH="381" HEIGHT="218" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1.png"
 ALT="\begin{figure}\begin{center}
\sf\bfseries\footnotesize {\color{white}\setlength\...
...pstree{\Toval{Bruce}}{
\Toval{Brittany}
\Tn
}
}
}}}
\end{center}\end{figure}">
</DIV>

<P>
The first operation is reading the tree from a file. Each line of the
file will describe one person, in a preorder traversal. That is, the
first line will be the root (<SPAN  CLASS="textsf">Helen</SPAN>, in the example), the next
line will be the left child (<SPAN  CLASS="textsf">Frank</SPAN>), followed by the left
child's descendents; after the entire left subtree (which ends with
<SPAN  CLASS="textsf">Susanna</SPAN> in the example), the file ends with the root's right
subtree (from <SPAN  CLASS="textsf">Esther</SPAN> to <SPAN  CLASS="textsf">Brittany</SPAN>). You may assume that
no name contains spaces. To specify the structure of the tree, each line
will also include a number indicating how many children that person has
(0, 1, or 2). Therefore, the example above would be represented by the
following file:
<PRE>
Helen 2
Frank 2
Alan 0
Brian 2
George 0
Susanna 0
Esther 2
Amy 0
Bruce 1
Brittany 0
</PRE>

<P>
The second operation is displaying the tree on the screen.  Use the
inorder traversal method that I describe in class, where each successive
level is indented a few more spaces.  For the example, the output should
look something like this:
<PRE>
    Alan
  Frank
      George
    Brian
      Susanna
Helen
    Amy
  Esther
      Brittany
    Bruce
</PRE>

<P>
Finally, the third operation is to ask the user for a name and search
for that name in the tree.  If it is found, you should print out the
relationship to the root, otherwise print <code>"no relation"</code> (see
examples below).  You may assume that there are no duplicate names in
the family.

<P>
For extra credit, you may extend this operation to
request <SPAN  CLASS="textit">two</SPAN> names, and respond with the relationship between the
two people (if any); for example, on input <SPAN  CLASS="textsf">Brian</SPAN> and
<SPAN  CLASS="textsf">Alan</SPAN> it should say <code>"sibling"</code>, while on input
<SPAN  CLASS="textsf">Brian</SPAN> and <SPAN  CLASS="textsf">Brittany</SPAN> it should say
<code>"first cousin once removed"</code> (talk to me if you want to know the
rules for this).

<P>
The main program should get a file name, read in the tree, display it,
and then enter a loop where it repeatedly asks for a name (or two names, in the
extra credit version) and displays the relationship.  When the user
enters the name <code>"DONE"</code>, the program should exit.  Here is a
sample run (starting after the tree is printed out, as above):
<PRE>
Name? Helen
Relationship: self

Name? Brian
Relationship: grandchild

Name? Esther
Relationship: child

Name? Susanna
Relationship: great grandchild

Name? Eleanor
Relationship: no relation

Name? DONE
Goodbye
</PRE>
