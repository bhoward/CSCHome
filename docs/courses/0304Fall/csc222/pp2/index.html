<P>
This project will be due by 5 pm, Monday, September 29.  To submit your
project, save it in the <code>pp2</code> directory located in your directory under
<code>/home/libs/dataStr/students/</code> on one of the department's Linux
machines (this is a shared directory, so you should be able to reach it
from any of the machines, including Jupiter).

<P>
You may work on this project by yourself or in a group of two or three.
If you work in a group, be sure to include everyone's name in the
comments at the top of <SPAN  CLASS="textit">each</SPAN> file.  Also, be sure you understand
the guidelines for group work listed in the syllabus--the fundamental
idea is that everyone in the group should understand what everyone else
has done, and be able to recreate it on their own.

<P>
The project is Programming Exercise 5-42 in the text (p. 279).
Note that the instruction for part (c) is misleading; it should read
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">(c)</SPAN> Use these new operations to implement the following
functions:

</BLOCKQUOTE>
That is, you should implement the <code>insertOrder</code> and
<code>removeDuplicates</code> functions using the <code>insert</code> and
<code>erase</code> members that you added to the miniVector class in parts (a)
and (b).

<P>
You should start by creating your <code>pp2</code> directory and copying the
book's miniVector implementation into it (the following commands assume
that you start in your directory under
<code>/home/libs/dataStr/students/</code>):
<PRE>
mkdir pp2
cd pp2
cp /home/libs/dataStr/pp2/minivec.h minivec.h
</PRE>
The member functions for parts (a) and (b) go in your <code>minivec.h</code>
file, while the code for parts (c) and (d) should go in a separate
<code>.cc</code> file in the same directory.  Remember to
<code>#include "minivec.h"</code> from your main program, so that the correct
version of miniVector will be defined.

<P>
Here is a sample output:
<PRE>
Original random integers:
11 1 19 6 13 18 17 13 3 4 2 4 13 3 8

Ordered integers using insertOrder:
1 2 3 3 4 4 6 8 11 13 13 13 17 18 19

Unique integers using removeDuplicates:
1 2 3 4 6 8 11 13 17 18 19
</PRE>
