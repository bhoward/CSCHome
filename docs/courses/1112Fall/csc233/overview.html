<dd>Alfred V. Aho and Jeffrey D. Ullman, "Foundations of Computer Science," W. H. Freeman, 1992 (available on
				<a href="https://moodle.depauw.edu/mod/resource/view.php?id=8191">Moodle</a> and from
				<a href="http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/focs.html"><code>http://infolab.stanford.edu/~ullman/focs.html</code></a>)</dd>
			
			
<dt>Course Description:</dt>
			
<dd>(from the Catalog) This course explores the theoretical foundations of computation at various levels of abstraction.
				Specific topics include graph theory and related algorithms; functional programming with an emphasis on recursion and
				recurrences; the description of languages using formalisms such as regular expressions, finite state machines, and
				context free grammars; and digital logic and its application to sequential and combinational circuits.</dd>
				
			
<dt>Grading:</dt>
			
<dd>The grade for this course will be based on the following:
				<ul>
					
<li>10%: Quizzes -- most classes will start with a short quiz, to encourage you to keep up with the reading;
						to avoid penalizing those who might miss a day or two, the bottom three quiz grades will be dropped</li>
					
<li>40%: Homework -- there will be an assignment due each Monday, except on exam days; some problems will
						require programming, but not on the scale of a full programming project</li>
					
<li>30%: In-term exams -- Friday, September 30 and Wednesday, November 9; each will cover the preceding five weeks</li>
					
<li>20%: Final exam -- Wednesday, December 14, 8:30-11:30 am; this will be comprehensive</li>
				
</ul>
				The grading scale used for this class will be the following: A (93-100), A- (90-92), B+ (87-89), B (83-86),
				B- (80-82), C+ (77-79), C (73-76), C- (70-72), D+ (67-69), D (63-66), D- (60-62), F (0-59). I reserve the right to
				alter this grading scale at any time. The last day to withdraw from class is Friday, March 18th.
			</dd>
			
			
<dt>Policy Statements:</dt>
			
<dd>
<ul>
				
<li>You are expected to attend all class sessions. However, I
					expect you to take your own education seriously, so I do not
					keep formal attendance records. If you miss a class, you are
					responsible for catching up with the material that was
					covered and any announcements that were made.</li>
				
<li>There will be no makeup quizzes.</li>
				
<li>Homework assignments are due by the
					start of class on the assigned date. Late submissions will be
					accepted until the next class time at a penalty of half the
					grade. Extensions will be considered <em>only</em> by prior
					arrangement.</li>
				
<li>Cheating, plagiarism, submission of the work of others, etc.,
					violates the DePauw policy on academic integrity and may
					result in penalties ranging from a lowered grade to course
					failure or expulsion. The policy and discussion of each
					student's obligations and rights are in the Student Handbook.</li>
				
<li>With respect to this course, no collaboration is permitted on
					exams or quizzes. You may discuss homework problems with anyone you want (in fact, you are
					encouraged to do so), but you should not copy another
					student's work nor permit your work to be copied. The key idea
					is that you should <em>understand</em> all of the work you turn
					in, and you should be able to replicate it on your own. If you
					do not feel that you can replicate the work independently, then
					it is not fair (to yourself or to others) to submit it as your
					own work. If at any time you are uncertain what constitutes
					"appropriate" collaboration, it is your responsibility to
					clarify it with me.</li>
				
<li>During class time, the computer at your seat should be used for
					note-taking, classroom interaction, and in-class exercises. You
					are not permitted to read e-mail, browse the web, play games,
					etc. while class is in session.</li>
				
<li>Regrade requests will be entertained for up to one week after the
					assignment or exam is returned to the student. To request a regrade,
					please write out on a separate sheet of paper your request and attach
					it to the assignment or exam, and give it to me. A simple request for
					more points without a justification is not sufficient! Keep in mind
					that the entire assignment or exam may be regraded, so carefully
					consider your requests!</li>
				
<li>Please feel free to offer me feedback (positive and negative) about
					my performance or anything else related to the class. This feedback
					will have no effect on your grade in the class.</li>
				
<li>Reading assignments will be given in class. They will mostly consist
					of readings from the class textbook, but other handouts and papers
					may be assigned as well.</li>
				
<li>All information about the class, whether given in this handout or
					in class, is subject to change.</li>
			
</ul>
