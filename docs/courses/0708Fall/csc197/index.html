<dt>Course Description:</dt>
<dd>
<p>This seminar will explore techniques for creating and manipulating pictures, sounds, and text through computer programming. While doing this, we will examine some of the implications of using a computer in the creative process: Who is the creator? Is it really art? What is the connection between structure, randomness, and aesthetics? Students will learn the basics of programming in a modern, high-level language, as well as a variety of methods of representing, generating, and modifying digital media such as bitmap images, vector drawings, audio wave files, and MIDI sequences. Classes will consist of a mixture of discussions, lectures, demonstrations, and hands-on lab experience.</p>

<p>Generally, the class sessions will follow this plan:</p>
<ul>
  <li>Monday: Demos of mini-projects, programming lecture and in-class excercises, assignment of programming homework</li>
  <li>Wednesday: Reading discussion and weekly reflection</li>
  <li>Friday: Review of programming homework, assignment of mini-project, lab time to work on mini-project</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>Grading:</dt>
<dd>The grade for this course will be based on the following:
  <ul>
    <li>Programming assignments and quizzes: in order to learn to program in Python, there will be weekly homework problems and occasional quizzes (20%)</li>
    <li>Midterm exam: Monday, October 1, covering the fundamentals of Python (15%)</li>
    <li>Writing assignments: two significant papers, plus weekly reflections (25%)</li>
    <li>Participation: contribute to discussions and demo sessions, and serve as one week's discussion leader (20%)</li>
    <li>Final project and portfolio of work (20%)</li>
  </ul>
<p>The grading scale used for this class will be the following: A
(93-100), A- (90-92), B+ (87-89), B (83-86), B- (80-82), C+
(77-79), C (73-76), C- (70-72), D+ (67-69), D (63-66), D-
(60-62), F(0-59). I reserve the right to alter this grading
scale at any time. The last day to withdraw from class is
Friday, October 12<sup>th</sup>.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Policy Statements:</dt>
<dd>
  <ul>
    <li>
      You are expected to attend all class sessions. However,
      I expect you to take your own education seriously, so I
      do not keep formal attendance records. If you miss a
      class, you are responsible for catching up with the
      material that was covered and any announcements that
      were made.
    </li>

    <li>
      Assignments are due at the start of class on the assigned
      date. Late submissions will be accepted until the next
      class time at a penalty of half the grade. Extensions
      will be considered <em>only</em> by prior arrangement.
    </li>

    <li>
      Cheating, plagiarism, submission of the work of others,
      etc., violates the DePauw policy on academic integrity
      and may result in penalties ranging from a lowered grade
      to course failure or expulsion. The policy and
      discussion of each student's obligations and rights are
      in the Student Handbook.
    </li>

    <li>
      With respect to this course, no collaboration is
      permitted on exams or quizzes. You may discuss homework
      problems and programming assignments with anyone you
      want (in fact, you are encouraged to do so), but you
      should not copy another student's work nor permit your
      work to be copied. The key idea is that you should
      <em>understand</em> all of the work you turn in, and you should be able to
      replicate it on your own. If you do not feel that you
      can replicate the work independently, then it is not
      fair (to yourself or to others) to submit it as your own
      work. If at any time you are uncertain what constitutes
      &quot;appropriate&quot; collaboration, it is your responsibility
      to clarify it with me.
    </li>

    <li>
      During class time, your computer should be
      used for note-taking, classroom interaction, and
      in-class exercises. You are not permitted to read
      e-mail, browse the web, play games, etc. while class is
      in session (unless the current activity calls for it...).
    </li>

    <li>
      Regrade requests will be entertained for up to one week
      after the assignment or exam is returned to the student.
      To request a regrade, please write out on a separate
      sheet of paper your request and attach it to the
      assignment or exam, and give it to me. A simple request
      for more points without a justification is not
      sufficient! Keep in mind that the entire assignment or
      exam may be regraded, so carefully consider your
      requests!
    </li>

    <li>
      Please feel free to offer me feedback (positive and
      negative) about my performance or anything else related
      to the class. This feedback will have no effect on your
      grade in the class.
    </li>

    <li>
      Reading assignments will be given in class. In addition to
      readings from the course text, additional materials will be
      provided, either as handouts or as links on the web.  You
      are expected to be prepared to discuss each day's reading
      when you arrive to class.
    </li>

    <li>
      All information about the class, whether given in this
      handout or in class, is subject to change.
    </li>
