<P>
Due:  Monday, May 5, in class.

<P>
Your job is to fill in the details of the Video Store Inventory
application described in Chapter 4 of the text.  There is a partially
completed project in <code>I:\CSC122\Public\Howard\Proj3Template</code> which
you should copy into your own folder.  In each of the <code>.cpp</code> files
in the project (except <code>getline.cpp</code>, which is just there to fix a
bug in Borland 5.02) there are sections of the code marked
<code>** TODO **</code>.  Fill in the details for each of these parts.

<P>
There is a working version of the project in the template folder, called
<code>ModelSolution.exe</code>.  You should try to make your program behave
the same way as the model.

<P>
You may work by yourself or with one or two partners.  No group may be
larger than three students.  Be sure to list all group members' names in
the comments in each file, and include the account number (such as
<code>CSC12200</code>) where the code is located.

<P>
When you are done, turn in a printout of all three source files,
together with the grading sheet which I will provide.
