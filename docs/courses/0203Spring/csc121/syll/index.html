<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Text:</STRONG></DT>
<DD><SPAN  CLASS="textit">Problems, Algorithms, Programs: A Laboratory
Centered Introduction to Computer Science Using C++</SPAN>. You should bring
the lab manual with you to <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">all</SPAN> class and lab sessions.

</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Laboratory:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The lab atmosphere is a relaxed one, where
interactions among students, and between student and instructor/lab
assistants, are encouraged. It is an interactive learning environment to
help you apply learned concepts, where questions and discussion are
encouraged. However, in order for you to benefit, you must complete the
labs and the prelab assignments as follows. Prelabs constitute one-half
of your lab grade. In order to receive credit for prelab assignments,
they are to be <SPAN  CLASS="textit">written out on paper</SPAN> and handed in at the
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">beginning</SPAN> of lab. The actual lab itself constitutes the other
half of your lab grade and must be completed <SPAN  CLASS="textit">no later than one
week</SPAN> after its scheduled time. Your lab instructor, Corey Kovacs
(<A HREF="mailto:ckovacs@depauw.edu">ckovacs@depauw.edu</A>, 658-4761, Julian A205) approves all
deviations from this lab policy.  <SPAN  CLASS="textit">Mr. Kovacs handles all
administrative parts of the laboratory experience.</SPAN>

</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Student Assistants:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Student assistants will schedule
consultations, one week prior to project due dates in the evenings. The
assistants will write their names on the whiteboards in Julian A112, to
indicate their presence.

</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Requirements:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>A computer lab each week (10 require a prelab
assignment to be completed before lab begins and handed in at the
beginning of lab), 3 computer programming projects, 2 hour exams, 1
final exam, written homework, quizzes and/or assignments.

</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Grading:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>15% for the first hour exam, 20% for the second hour
exam, 25% for the final exam, 10% for the computer labs (including both
the prelab assignments, and attending the lab and putting in a
good-faith effort), 15% for computer projects, 15% for homework, quizzes
and/or other assignments.

</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Final Grades:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The following scale will be used to compute your
final grades: A (93-100), A- (90-92), B+ (87-89), B (83-86), B- (80-82),
C+ (77-79), C (73-76), C- (70-72), D+ (67-69), D (63-66), D- (60-62),
F (0-59).

</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Caveat:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>You cannot learn to drive a car or to maintain
friendships simply by listening to someone explain how to do it. Rather,
you must practice, often making mistakes. The same is true of learning
the material in this course. Feel free to ask as many questions as you
want. It is my desire that you leave this course with a feeling of
accomplishment and satisfaction gained from learning about a subject
area that fascinates me.

</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Important Dates:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The deadline for withdrawing from class is 3/14.
The three computer projects will be due during the weeks starting Monday
3/10, 4/7 and 5/5, respectively. The exams will be given in the evening
to all sections of this course. The first hour exam will be given on
Wednesday 3/5 at 7pm, and the second one will be on Wednesday 4/16 at
7pm. The second exam falls on the Jewish Passover holiday. If this is a
religious conflict for you, please contact your instructor at least a
week before the exam and an alternative exam time will <SPAN  CLASS="textit">gladly</SPAN> be
arranged for you. The final exam for this section of the course is
scheduled for Monday May 12, 1-4pm.

</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Important Information:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>You must have taken UNIV101 or be
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">qualified to enroll in your Q course</SPAN> in order to attempt this
course.

To earn ``Q-credit'' for this class, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">you must earn at least a
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">C</SPAN> average on your exams (hour exams + final)</SPAN> <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">and</SPAN> you
must earn at least a <SPAN  CLASS="textbf">C</SPAN> average in the class.

CSC121 is a group one offering; CSC121 is <SPAN  CLASS="textit">not</SPAN>, however, a group
one laboratory offering. <SPAN  CLASS="textit">There is no group one laboratory credit
for this course.</SPAN>

</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Policy Statements:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>&nbsp;

<UL>
<LI>You are expected to attend all class sessions. However, I expect
you to take your own education seriously, so I do not keep formal
attendance records. If you miss a class, you are responsible for
catching up with the material that was covered and any announcements
that were made.

</LI>
<LI>Homework assignments are due by the start of class, and
programming projects are due by 5:00 p.m. on the assigned date.  Late
submissions will be accepted until the next class time at a penalty of
half the grade.  Extensions will be considered <SPAN  CLASS="textit">only</SPAN> by
prior arrangement.

</LI>
<LI>Cheating, plagiarism, submission of the work of others, etc.,
violates the DePauw policy on academic integrity and may result in
penalties ranging from a lowered grade to course failure or expulsion.
The policy and discussion of each student's obligations and rights are
in the Student Handbook.

With respect to this course, no collaboration is permitted on exams or
quizzes.  You may discuss homework problems and programming assignments
with anyone you want (in fact, you are encouraged to do so), but you
should not copy another student's work nor permit your work to be
copied.  The key idea is that you should <SPAN  CLASS="textit">understand</SPAN> all of the
work you turn in, and you should be able to replicate it on your own.
If you do not feel that you can replicate the work independently, then
it is not fair (to yourself or to others) to submit it as your own work.
If at any time you are uncertain what constitutes ``appropriate''
collaboration, it is your responsibility to clarify it with me.

</LI>
<LI>Programming projects will be graded on style and efficiency as
well as correct operation.  To develop as a programmer, you are strongly
encouraged to do more than the minimum assigned amount of work; the best
way to learn good style and common idioms is to read and write lots of
code.
</LI>
