<P>
This assignment is due by the start of class on Friday, February 28. You
are encouraged to do this homework with your partner, and you are
welcome to get help on it during the lab time Tuesday.

<P>
Submit a printout of your solution to the problem below. Make sure that
your name and account name are in comments at the top; for example,
<PRE>
/* Description: Programming Homework 3
   Filename:    program3.cpp
   Account:     CSC121xx
   Author:      Your Name
   Date:        Today's Date
*/
</PRE>
If you work with your partner, you only need to submit one copy of the
program; be sure that both of your names are listed in the comments (the
account name should be the one in which the solution is stored).

<P>
You should start by copying the folder called <code>Program3</code> from my
public directory, <code>I:\CSC121\public\Howard\</code>, into your own folder,
<code>I:\CSC121\CSC121xx\</code>.  When you open your copy of the project, by
following the same instructions as for the labs, you should see the
comments shown above; modify them as needed and continue writing your
program.

<P>
Please remember that you will be graded on program style as well
as correct output.  Style points include proper use of functions to
break up your code, indentation of function and loop bodies to make the
structure of your code easy to read, and the inclusion of comments to
identify the parts of the program and to state the required pre- and
post-conditions for each function other than <code>main</code>.  A program
without all of these style points will not receive full credit.

<P>
The assignment is to produce a program that first asks for a number of
grades, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>, and then asks for a grade <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> times in succession.  For
each of the <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> grades, which should be a number between 0 and 100, it
should print the corresponding letter grade (use the scale where 90 and
up is an A, 80 to 89 is a B, 70 to 79 is a C, 60 to 69 is a D, and 0 to
59 is an F).  It should also count how many of each letter grade are
entered; at the end, it should print a table giving these counts.

<P>
For example, here is a sample session (the <code>_</code>'s are to indicate
user input; your program will not show them):
<PRE>
How many grades? _5_
Enter grade 1: _92_
That's an A
Enter grade 2: _73_
That's a C
Enter grade 3: _80_
That's a B
Enter grade 4: _100_
That's an A
Enter grade 5: _59_
That's an F

Grade counts
A: 2
B: 1
C: 1
D: 0
F: 1
</PRE>

<P>
Your program should also contain the usual introduction and farewell
messages.  The <code>main</code> function should just call the other functions
in sequence; it should not contain any of the grade reading or counting
code itself.
