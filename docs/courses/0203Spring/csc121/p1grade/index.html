<P>
Please turn in this sheet stapled to the printout of your program.

<P>

<UL>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Style (50 points)</SPAN>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>_____</STRONG> (5 points) Program has appropriate comments at the top
that describe what the program accomplishes, and who wrote it.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>_____</STRONG> (5 points) The comments include the full name of the
folder containing the program (for example,
<code>I:\CSC121\CSC12101\Project1</code>). I need this so that I can easily
find your program on the network drive.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>_____</STRONG> (10 points) All functions have correct pre- and
post-conditions. Points will be subtracted if they are not true or are
incomplete.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>_____</STRONG> (10 points) The code is correctly indented.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>_____</STRONG> (10 points) All variable, constant, and function names
(and any other identifiers) are descriptive and appropriate. It is OK to
use <code>x</code> for an <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN>-coordinate or <code>i</code> for a loop index, but in
general a name should be a (meaningful) complete word or phrase.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>_____</STRONG> (10 points) Each function does one unique task and no
function is inappropriately long. A rule of thumb is that the entire
function should fit on the screen when editing it.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Stage 1 (10 points)</SPAN>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>_____</STRONG> (10 points) A difficulty level is requested from the user
and the square moves at different speeds accordingly.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Stage 2 (10 points)</SPAN>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>_____</STRONG> (10 points) The object bounces off the sides.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Stage 3 (30 points)</SPAN>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>_____</STRONG> (5 points) A fuel ball appears at the bottom of the
screen.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>_____</STRONG> (15 points) A fuel ball is launched in one of three
directions, according to one of three keys being pressed. If any other
key is pressed, it beeps.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>_____</STRONG> (10 points) As the fuel ball disappears off the top of the
screen, the program stops.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Extra Credit</SPAN>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>_____</STRONG> Do the remaining stages, or come up with your own creative
extensions.  The amount of extra credit will be determined by how
impressed I am, and will not exceed 20 points.
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Late Penalty</SPAN>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>_____</STRONG> As described in the syllabus, ``Late submissions will be
accepted until the next class time at a penalty of half the grade.
Extensions will be considered <SPAN  CLASS="textit">only</SPAN> by prior arrangement.''
Submission time will be determined by the last modification time on the
source file in the <code>I:</code> drive, so be sure not to edit the project
after it has been submitted.
