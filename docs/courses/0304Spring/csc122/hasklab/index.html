<P>
By working through the steps in this handout, you will develop a HasCl
program to draw a picture made up of many overlapping squares of
different sizes and colors.

<P>

<OL>
<LI>The following data type, which is defined in the Graphics module
in Funnie, represents a graphical object to be displayed on the screen:
<PRE>
data Graphic = Square(Num, Num, Num, Color) | Over(Graphic, Graphic) | Blank
</PRE>
This says that a <code>Graphic</code> value is either a single square or the
combination of one <code>Graphic</code> over another, or nothing at all. A
square needs four parameters--the value <code>Square(x, y, w, c)</code>
describes a square whose lower-left corner is at the point <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(<I>x</I>, <I>y</I>)</SPAN>, with
width <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>w</I></SPAN> and color <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>c</I></SPAN>. The first three parameters, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>y</I></SPAN>, and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>w</I></SPAN>,
are all numbers expressing positions or distances relative to the
coordinate system of the graphics window: the lower-left corner is at
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">(- 50, - 50)</SPAN>, and the upper-right corner is at <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(50, 50)</SPAN>, regardless of the
actual size of the window. The color, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>c</I></SPAN>, is specified as a value of
the following data type, which is also defined in the Graphics module:
<PRE>
data Color = RGB(Num, Num, Num)
</PRE>
The value <code>RGB(r, g, b)</code> specifies a color with red, green, and
blue components given by the numbers <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>r</I></SPAN>, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>g</I></SPAN>, and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>b</I></SPAN>, respectively,
where each component ranges from 0 (completely absent) to 255 (full
strength).  The Graphics module also defines some useful constants of
type <code>Color</code>; for example, <code>red</code> is the value
<code>RGB(255,0,0)</code> (look in the module browser in Funnie to see what
other colors are defined).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>For this item, all we will do is display a single square.
Following the description above, we can form a green square, 30 units on
each side, with lower-left corner at <SPAN CLASS="MATH">(10, 20)</SPAN>, by using the expression
<code>Square(10, 20, 30, RGB(0, 255, 0))</code>. If you type this in, the
system should pop-up a graphics window containing the square.

<P>
For testing, it will be convenient to define some sample
squares. Enter each of the following in a separate definition window:
<PRE>
redGiant = Square(-20, -10, 50, RGB(255, 0, 0))
whiteDwarf = Square(10, 30, 20, RGB(255, 255, 255))
purpleMedium = Square(0, -20, 35, RGB(128, 0, 128))
</PRE>
Now you can easily draw a square by entering its name, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">e.g.</SPAN>,
<code>redGiant</code>, in a Funnie expression window. However, this only lets
you draw one square at a time. To combine several squares in one
picture, we need the <code>Over</code> constructor of the <code>Graphic</code> data
type, as follows: <code>Over(redGiant, whiteDwarf)</code>. Notice how the
squares are combined, and see what happens if you reverse the order of
the squares.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Now let's create a list of <code>Square</code>s. We will need a function
which takes a list of squares and combines them all
into a single <code>Graphic</code>. As usual when working with a list of
things, we will define the function by recursion. Here is the base case,
which uses the special value <code>Blank</code> to produce a blank
picture:
<PRE>
showSquareList([ ]) = Blank
</PRE>
The recursive case will have the following form:
<PRE>
showSquareList([s : ss]) =
</PRE>
When this pattern matches, <code>s</code> will be the first square on the
list, and <code>ss</code> will be a list of the remaining squares. Write an
appropriate right-hand side for this case of the function. The square
<code>s</code> is already a <code>Graphic</code>; you will need to use
<code>showSquareList</code> to produce another <code>Graphic</code> from <code>ss</code>.
These two <code>Graphic</code>s will then need to be combined into one with
<code>Over</code>. When you have defined the function, try it out with
<code>showSquareList([redGiant, whiteDwarf])</code>.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>We will also want a function to <SPAN  CLASS="textit">generate</SPAN> a list of squares,
so that we don't have to type them all in by hand. Here is an example:
<PRE>
diagonalSquares(x, y, d, rgb, 0) = [ ]
diagonalSquares(x, y, d, rgb, n) = [Square(x, y, d, rgb) :
                                    diagonalSquares(x+d/2, y+d/2, d, rgb, n-1)]
</PRE>
After entering this function, evaluate
<code>showSquareList(diagonalSquares(-30, -30, 10, white, 9))</code>.
The cases for this function mean that <code>diagonalSquares(x, y, d, rgb, n)</code>
will produce a list of <code>n</code> squares (because the list is empty
when <code>n</code> is <code>0</code>, and it gets one extra element for each
recursive call as <code>n</code> counts down to <code>0</code>). The first one will
have its corner at <code>(x,y)</code>, with width <code>d</code> and color
<code>rgb</code>. Succeeding squares will be offset by adding <code>d/2</code> to the
<code>x</code> and <code>y</code> coordinates of the corner; the effect will be that
each square will be centered on the upper-right corner of the previous
one. You should get a picture that looks like a white staircase.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>A simple modification to the previous code gives us a chain of
squares of different sizes. Create a new function named
<code>vanishingSquares</code> which is similar to <code>diagonalSquares</code>
except replace the size argument <code>d</code> in the recursive call (to
<code>vanishingSquares</code>, of course) with the expression <code>d*3/4</code>.
To try this out, you will probably want to start with a larger
initial square; something like this should work:
<code>showSquareList(vanishingSquares(-30, -30, 20, white, 7))</code>

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Now we can approach our original goal of creating an interesting
picture by replacing the single recursive call in the previous item with
four separate calls, one at each of the four corners of the central
square. Each of these recursive calls will produce a list of squares, so
we will need to append all of the lists together, using <code>++</code>. Here
is a skeleton of the code for you to fill in:
<PRE>
squareDesign(x, y, d, rgb, 0) = 
squareDesign(x, y, d, rgb, n) = [Square(x, y, d, rgb) :
                                 squareDesign(x-d/4, y-d/4, d/2, rgb, n-1) ++
                                 squareDesign(x-d/4, y+3*d/4, d/2, rgb, n-1) ++
                                 squareDesign(                             ) ++
                                 squareDesign(                               )]
</PRE>
When you have successfully compiled the finished function, try
evaluating the following expression:
<code>showSquareList(squareDesign(-20, -20, 40, white, 4))</code>.
You can change the <code>4</code> to <code>5</code> to draw one more level, but it
will take too long if you try to do 6 or more levels (each level has
four times as many squares, so there are 1024 squares at level 6).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The last step will be to change the color as well as the size.
Modify the recursive calls so that the upper-left and lower-right
corners have only half the red component of the current square, while
the upper-right and lower-left corners have only half the green
component; leave the blue component untouched.  The easiest way to do
this is to write two auxilliary functions, <code>lessRed</code> and
<code>lessGreen</code>, each of type <code>(Color) -&gt; Color</code>.  Here is one:
<PRE>
lessRed(RGB(r, g, b)) = RGB(r/2, g, b)
</PRE>
You will need to enter this and a similar definition for
<code>lessGreen</code>, then write a new function similar to
<code>squareDesign</code> that calls these functions in the appropriate
places. Call this new function <code>colorDesign</code>, and test it.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>As a final problem, how could you change the code to draw the
larger squares on the bottom, instead of on top? Whichever function
needs to be modified, name the new version by appending a <code>2</code>; for
example, if you modify <code>colorDesign</code>, then your new function should
be named <code>colorDesign2</code>.
