<h3>Linked Lists - Lindenmayer Systems</h3>
		
<h3>Deadline: Friday, November 10, 5:00 p.m.</h3>

		
<dl>
			
<dt>Overview:</dt>
			
<dd>
			
<p>You are to write a program that generates fractals using
			what are known as <em>Lindenmayer systems</em>, or L-systems.  The concept
			of an L-system was introduced in the 1960's by Aristid Lindenmayer
			as a simple model of the growth of plants.  It is based on the idea
			of a <em>formal grammar</em>, as used by linguists to analyze the
			structure of natural languages (and by computer scientists to specify
			the structure of programming languages).  For more details on
			the theory behind L-systems, consult
			<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system"><code>http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L-system</code></a>.</p>
			
			
<p>The best way to understand the version of L-system we will be
			using is to consider a simple example (this is essentially Lindenmayer's
			original model for the growth of algae, although we will cast it in more
			familiar terms).  Let the symbol B represent a baby bunny, and let the
			symbol A stand for an adult rabbit.  If we assume that an adult rabbit
			produces one baby bunny each month, and that it takes a baby one month to
			mature into an adult, then we could model the growth of a population of
			rabbits with the following rules:</p>
			
<ul>
				
<li>A --&gt; AB</li>
				
<li>B --&gt; A</li>
			
</ul>
			
<p>The arrow (--&gt;) is read as "produces" or "develops into" (after one
			month), so the first rule says that an adult rabbit develops into an adult
			(itself) and a baby after one month, while a baby bunny develops into an
			adult after one month.  We are also assuming that these (idealized) rabbits
			are immortal; as you can see in the interpretation of the rules, each
			rabbit present in one month will continue into the next (accompanied by
			an ever-increasing crowd of relatives...).</p>
			
			
<p>In addition to a set of symbols and a list of rules, an L-system
			needs a starting point, known as the "axiom".  For our rabbits, suppose
			we start with a single baby bunny, B, as our axiom.  Given a starting
			point, an L-system develops in a series of stages (months, in our case).
			At each stage, every member in the current population (represented as a
			string of symbols) is replaced by the right-hand-side of the rule for
			that symbol; if there is no rule for a given symbol, it remains unchanged.
			For example, here are the first few stages of the growth of our rabbit
			population:</p>
			
<table summary="rabbit population growth">
			
<thead>
				
<tr>
					
<td>Month</td><td>Population</td>
				
</tr>
			
</thead>
			
<tbody>
				
<tr>
					
<td>0</td><td>B</td>
				
</tr>
				
<tr>
					
<td>1</td><td>A</td>
				
</tr>
				
<tr>
					
<td>2</td><td>AB</td>
				
</tr>
				
<tr>
					
<td>3</td><td>ABA</td>
				
</tr>
				
<tr>
					
<td>4</td><td>ABAAB</td>
				
</tr>
				
<tr>
					
<td>5</td><td>ABAABABA</td>
				
</tr>
				
<tr>
					
<td>6</td><td>ABAABABAABAAB</td>
				
</tr>
			
</tbody>
			
</table>
			
			
<p>Looking at the size of the rabbit population in each month reveals
			a familiar sequence: 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, ....  Indeed, we have
			reproduced the original model of rabbit population growth studied by
			Leonardo of Pisa (son of Bonacci, hence "Fibonacci") about 800 years
			ago, although of course he didn't phrase it in terms of L-systems.</p>
			
			
<p>To summarize, an L-system is specified by giving a list of rules
			describing how the symbols develop in each stage, plus an axiom which
			serves as the starting string of symbols.  We will only consider
			<em>deterministic</em> L-systems, where there is at most one rule for
			each symbol, although the generalization to <em>stochastic</em> L-systems
			(where one of several rules is chosen at random for each symbol) is also
			very interesting.</p>
			
			
<p>To use an L-system to generate fractals, we will apply a graphical
			interpretation to some of the generated symbols.  The graphics will be in
			the form of commands to a "turtle" -- an imaginary animal that crawls
			around leaving trails on the screen.  Our turtle will be provided by the
			<code>Turtle</code> class, which has the following methods:</p>
			
<ul>
				
<li>
<strong>init():</strong> resets the turtle on a blank screen,
				heading to the right (in the positive x direction)</li>
				
<li>
<strong>drawForward():</strong> moves the turtle one unit forward
				and leaves a trail</li>
				
<li>
<strong>moveForward():</strong> moves the turtle one unit forward
				but does not leave a trail</li>
				
<li>
<strong>left():</strong> turns the turtle counter-clockwise by the
				angle delta (see below)</li>
				
<li>
<strong>right():</strong> turns the turtle clockwise by the angle
				delta (see below)</li>
				
<li>
<strong>reverse():</strong> turns the turtle around 180 degrees</li>
				
<li>
<strong>reflect():</strong> switches the meaning of left and right
				("flips the turtle on its back")</li>
				
<li>
<strong>push():</strong> saves the current position and heading of
				the turtle on a stack</li>
				
<li>
<strong>pop():</strong> restores a position and heading from the
				stack</li>
				
<li>
<strong>setDelta(float delta):</strong> sets the turtle's basic
				turning angle to <strong>delta</strong>, measured in degrees; the default
				value for a newly-constructed turtle is 90 degrees -- usually you will
				want to call setDelta immediately after constructing the turtle</li>
				
<li>
<strong>display():</strong> shows a window with a visual representation
				of the trail left by the turtle; it will be scaled and centered to fit in
				the window</li>
			
</ul>
			
			
<p>You will need to write a function called <strong>interpret</strong> that
			takes a sequence of symbols (as generated by running the L-system to a given
			stage) and gives the appropriate sequence of commands to the turtle.  You
			should follow the conventions of the program FRACTINT
			(<a href="http://spanky.triumf.ca/www/fractint/fractint.html"><code>http://spanky.triumf.ca/www/fractint/fractint.html</code></a>)
			which interprets F as <strong>drawForward</strong>, G as
			<strong>moveForward</strong>, + as <strong>right</strong>, - as
			<strong>left</strong>, | as <strong>reverse</strong>, ! as <strong>reflect</strong>,
			[ as <strong>push</strong>, and ] as <strong>pop</strong>; any other character is ignored.
			For example, if the sequence of symbols were stored in a String, you could write the following:</p>
			
<pre>
    public void interpret(String sequence, delta)
    {
        Turtle t = new Turtle();
        t.setDelta(delta);
        t.init();
        for (int i = 0; i &lt; sequence.length(); i++) {
            switch(sequence.charAt(i)) {
            case 'F':
                t.drawForward();
                break;
            case 'G':
                t.moveForward();
                break;
            case '+':
                t.right();
                break;
            case '-':
                t.left();
                break;
            case '|':
                t.reverse();
                break;
            case '!':
                t.reflect();
                break;
            case '[':
                t.push();
                break;
            case ']':
                t.pop();
                break;
            default:
                // Do nothing
                break;
            }
        }
        t.display();
    }
			</pre>
			
			
<p>Given this function, calling <code>interpret("F-F++F-F", 60)</code>
			results in the following display:</p>
			
<img src="koch1.png" alt="Stage 1 Koch curve">
			<p>This is the first stage of part of the Koch snowflake curve.  The entire
			curve may be generated using the axiom F++F++F and the single rule
			F --&gt; F-F++F-F; here is the result of applying this rule for 3 stages:</p>
			
<img src="koch3.png" alt="Stage 3 Koch snowflake">
			<p>As a final example, the axiom FX together with the rules F --&gt; (nothing),
			X --&gt; -FX++FY-, and Y --&gt; +FX--FY+ produce the "dragon curve".  Here it is,
			generated to 15 stages (resulting in about 200,000 symbols) and interpreted
			with an angle of 45 degrees:</p>
			
<img src="dragon15.png" alt="Stage 15 Dragon curve">
			
			<p>Of course, since this project deals with linked lists, you won't have
			the sequence of symbols stored in a String, so you can't use the above
			version of <strong>interpret</strong> without modification.  Why don't
			we want to use a String?  Because many L-systems produce sequences that
			grow exponentially in the number of stages, so we may well be generating
			sequences of millions of symbols.  Although it isn't a problem just to store
			millions of characters in a Java String, it <em>is</em> a problem to
			replace one of those characters by the several that might take its place
			when generating the next stage of a sequence -- besides the fact that
			Java String objects are immutable, so you have to make a copy of the
			entire String to change any part of it, there is the simple problem for
			any data structure using contiguous storage that to insert several things
			in place of one <em>you have to shift everything else to make room</em>!
			These problems are solved if we switch to a linked-list representation of
			the sequence of symbols: it is an easy matter to splice in a replacement
			set of nodes each time a symbol needs to be substituted by the
			right-hand-side of its corresponding rule.</p>
			
</dd>

			
<dt>Specification:</dt>
			
<dd>
			
<p>
<strong>Input file format:</strong> The input to the program will be
			a text file giving the following information on successive lines:</p>
			
<ul>
				
<li>The axiom of the L-system</li>
				
<li>The number of rules in the L-system</li>
				
<li>The rules of the L-system, each on two lines: the first line will
				give the symbol on the left-hand-side of the rule, and the second line
				will give the (possibly empty) sequence of replacement symbols on the
				right-hand-side of the rule</li>
				
<li>The number of stages to generate</li>
				
<li>The angle delta to assign to the turtle</li>
			
</ul>
			
<p>All of the symbols used in rules will be from the ASCII character set, so you
			can rely on their code values being less than 128 (in case you want to
			use them as array indices, for example).</p>
			
			
<p>For example, here is a file describing the dragon curve shown above
			(this is the file <code>dragon.txt</code> in the folder
			<code>I:\CSC122\public\LSystem</code>):</p>
			
<pre>
    FX
    3
    F
    
    X
    -FX++FY-
    Y
    +FX--FY+
    15
    45
			</pre>
			
			
<p>You should use the <strong>Infile</strong> class from the previous
			projects to read the lines of the file.  To convert a string <code>s</code> to an
			int, use the static method <code>Integer.parseInt(s)</code>; there
			are similar methods for the other primitive types (for example,
			<code>Float.parseFloat(s)</code>).</p>

<dt>The Project and Getting Started:</dt>
			
<dd>
				
<p>
<strong>The LSystem project:</strong>
</p>
				
<ul>
					
<li>The project should consist of at least four classes &ndash; Driver,
					    LSystem, Turtle, and Infile.</li>
					
<li>Driver (client) &ndash; Creates an instance of LSystem and invokes
						appropriate methods from it.</li>
					
<li>LSystem (server and client) &ndash; Provides methods to read a system
					    description from an Infile, generate the appropriate number of
					    stages of the system, and interpret the result by giving a
					    sequence of Turtle commands.  The sequences of symbols should
					    be generated as a linked list, so there should also be a Node
					    class (perhaps private to LSystem, or perhaps housed in a
					    separate LinkedList class).</li>
					
<li>Turtle (server) - This class will be given to you in the
						LSystem folder, and is described above.</li>
					
<li>Infile (server) &ndash; This class will be given to you in the
						LSystem folder, and is the same as in previous projects.</li>
					
<li>The provided files can be copied from I:\csc122\public\LSystem</li>
					
<li>Implement the project using the test-driven implementation
						strategy: first build a test system and stubbed
						implementation of each class.</li>
				
</ul>

				
<p>
<strong>Standards:</strong>
</p>
				
<p>Your project should be well-written, neatly-formatted, modular,
					and well-documented.</p>

				
<p>
<strong>Grading:</strong>
</p>
				
<ul>
					
<li>Reading the L-system description (20 pts)</li>
					
<li>Generating the stages of the L-system (40 points)</li>
					
<li>Interpreting the resulting sequence of symbols (20 points)</li>
					
<li>Documentation and style (20 points)</li>
