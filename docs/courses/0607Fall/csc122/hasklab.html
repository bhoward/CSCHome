<h2>HasCl Laboratory Exercise</h2>
	
	
	


<p>By working through the steps in this handout, you will
    develop a HasCl program to draw a picture made up of many
    overlapping squares of different sizes and colors.</p>

    
<ol>
      
<li>
        The following data type, which is defined in the graphics
        module in Funnie, represents a graphical object to be
        displayed on the screen (in fact, this is a simplification--the
        full <code>Shape</code> type has several other constructors): 
<pre>
data Shape = Poly([(Num, Num)], Color, Color) | Over(Shape, Shape) | Blank;
</pre>
        This says that a <code>Shape</code> value is either a
        polygon, or the combination of one
        <code>Shape</code> over another, or nothing at all. A
        polygon needs three parameters--the value <code>Poly(ps, c1, c2)</code>
        describes a polygon whose vertices are given by the list <code>ps</code>,
        with border color <code>c1</code> and interior color <code>c2</code>.
        Each point in the list of vertices is a pair <code>(x, y) :: (Num, Num)</code>.
        The coordinate system of the graphics window (which pops up when you
        evaluate an expression of type <code>Shape</code>) initially has the point
        <code>(0, 0)</code> at the upper-left corner and <code>(200, 200)</code> at
        the lower-right, although this will change as you resize the window,
        pan around (click and drag the mouse), or zoom in and out (if you have
        a mouse with a scroll wheel). A color is specified as a value of
        the following data type, which is also defined in the
        graphics module: 
<pre>
data Color = RGBA(Num, Num, Num, Num);
</pre>
        The value <code>RGBA(r, g, b, a)</code> specifies a color with
        red, green, blue, and "alpha" components given by the numbers <span class="MATH"><i>r</i></span>, <span class="MATH"><i>g</i></span>, <span class="MATH"><i>b</i></span>, and <span class="MATH"><i>a</i></span> respectively, where each
        component ranges from 0 (completely absent) to 255 (full
        strength). The alpha level determines the transparency of the color, from
        0 for completely transparent to 255 for completely opaque. The graphics module also defines some useful
        constants of type <code>Color</code>; for example,
        <code>red</code> is the value <code>RGBA(255, 0, 0, 255)</code>
        (look in the graphics module function browser in Funnie to see what other
        colors are defined).  There is also a function 
        <code>RGB :: (Num, Num, Num) -&gt; Color</code> which makes it easier
        to create an opaque color given just the red, green, and blue components.
      </li>

      
<li>
        In this lab, we will only be working with squares, so we will start by defining
        a function to draw a square given its location, size, and color.  Open a new
        module window and enter the following in the source tab:
        <pre>
import std.graphics;

square(x, y, r, c) = Poly([(x-r, y-r), (x+r, y-r), (x+r, y+r), (x-r, y+r)], c, c);
        </pre>
        The <code>import</code> declaration is similar to the one in Java--it tells
        the compiler that we want to use the definitions from another module (by default,
        only definitions in the current module and <code>std.base</code> are available).
        This function will create a polygon with four vertices, giving us a square with
        center <code>(x, y)</code> and half-width <code>r</code> (like the radius of a
        circle--for our purposes, this will be a convenient way to specify a square).
        Both the border and the interior will be of color <code>c</code>.
      </li>
      
      
<li>
        For this item, all we will do is display a single square.
        Using the function above, we can form a green
        square, 30 units on each side, with center  at
        <span class="MATH">(50, 40)</span>, by using the expression
        <code>square(50, 40, 15, RGB(0, 255, 0))</code>. If you
        type this in, the system should pop-up a graphics window
        containing the square. 

        <p>For testing, it will be convenient to define some sample
        squares. Add each of the following to the source in your module window and compile:</p>

<pre>
redGiant = square(70, 80, 50, RGB(255, 0, 0));
whiteDwarf = square(20, 50, 10, RGB(255, 255, 255));
purpleMedium = square(60, 40, 30, RGB(128, 0, 128));
</pre>
        Now you can easily draw a square by entering its name,
        <span class="textit">e.g.</span>, <code>redGiant</code>, in
        the module's expression window. However, this only lets you
        draw one square at a time. To combine several squares in
        one picture, we need the <code>Over</code> constructor of
        the <code>Shape</code> data type, as follows:
        <code>Over(redGiant, purpleMedium)</code>. Notice how the
        squares are combined, and see what happens if you reverse
        the order of the squares.  For convenience, you may also use
        the <code>+++</code> operator to put one <code>Shape</code> over
        another: try <code>whiteDwarf +++ purpleMedium +++ redGiant</code>.
      </li>

      
<li>
        Now let's display a list of shapes. We will
        need a function which takes a list of shapes and combines
        them all into a single <code>Shape</code>. As usual when
        working with a list of things, we will define the function
        by recursion. Here is the base case, which uses the special
        value <code>Blank</code> to produce a blank picture: 
<pre>
showShapeList([ ]) = Blank;
</pre>
        The recursive case will have the following form: 
<pre>
showShapeList([s : ss]) =                    ;
</pre>
        When this pattern matches, <code>s</code> will be the first
        shape on the list, and <code>ss</code> will be a list of
        the remaining shapes. Write an appropriate right-hand side
        for this case of the function. The shape <code>s</code> is
        already a <code>Shape</code>; you will need to use
        <code>showShapeList</code> to produce another
        <code>Shape</code> from <code>ss</code>. These two
        <code>Shape</code>s will then need to be combined into
        one with <code>Over</code>. When you have defined the
        function, try it out with <code>showShapeList([redGiant,
        whiteDwarf])</code>.
      </li>

      
<li>
        We will also want a function to <span class="textit">generate</span> a list of squares, so that
        we don't have to type them all in by hand. Here is an
        example: 
<pre>
diagonalSquares(x, y, r, c, 0) = [ ];
diagonalSquares(x, y, r, c, n) = [square(x, y, r, c) :
                                    diagonalSquares(x+r, y+r, r, c, n-1)];
</pre>
        After entering this function, evaluate
        <code>showShapeList(diagonalSquares(30, 30, 10, blue,
        9))</code>. The cases for this function mean that
        <code>diagonalSquares(x, y, r, c, n)</code> will produce
        a list of <code>n</code> squares (because the list is empty
        when <code>n</code> is <code>0</code>, and it gets one
        extra element for each recursive call as <code>n</code>
        counts down to <code>0</code>). The first one will have its
        center at <code>(x,y)</code>, with half-width <code>r</code> and
        color <code>c</code>. Succeeding squares will be offset
        by adding <code>r</code> to the <code>x</code> and
        <code>y</code> coordinates of the corner; the effect will
        be that each square will be centered on the lower-right
        corner of the previous one. You should get a picture that
        looks like a blue staircase.
      </li>

      
<li>A simple modification to the previous code gives us a
      chain of squares of different sizes. Create a new function
      named <code>vanishingSquares</code> which is similar to
      <code>diagonalSquares</code>, except replace the size argument
      <code>r</code> in the recursive call (to
      <code>vanishingSquares</code>, of course) with the expression
      <code>r*3/4</code>. To try this out, you will probably want
      to start with a larger initial square; something like this
      should work: <code>showSquareList(vanishingSquares(30, 30,
      20, blue, 7))</code>
</li>

      
<li>
        Now we can approach our original goal of creating an
        interesting picture by replacing the single recursive call
        in the previous step with four separate calls, one at each
        of the four corners of the initial square. Each of these
        recursive calls will produce a list of squares, so we will
        need to append all of the lists together, using
        <code>++</code>. Here is a skeleton of the code for you to
        fill in: 
<pre>
squareDesign(x, y, r, c, 0) =     ;
squareDesign(x, y, r, c, n) = [square(x, y, r, c) :
                                 squareDesign(x-r, y-r, r/2, c, n-1) ++
                                 squareDesign(x+r, y-r, r/2, c, n-1) ++
                                 squareDesign(                     ) ++
                                 squareDesign(                     )];
</pre>
        When you have successfully compiled the finished function,
        try evaluating the following expression:
        <code>showShapeList(squareDesign(100, 100, 40, blue, 4))</code>.
        You can change the <code>4</code> to
        <code>5</code> to draw one more level, but it will take too
        long if you try to do 6 or more levels (each level has four
        times as many squares, so there are 1024 squares at level
        6).
      </li>

      
<li>
        The last step will be to change the color as well as the
        size. Modify the recursive calls so that the upper-left and
        lower-right corners have only half the red component of the
        current square, while the upper-right and lower-left
        corners have only half the green component; leave the blue and alpha
        components untouched. The easiest way to do this is to write
        two auxilliary functions, <code>lessRed</code> and
        <code>lessGreen</code>, each of type <code>(Color) -&gt;
        Color</code>. Here is one: 
<pre>
lessRed(RGBA(r, g, b, a)) = RGBA(r/2, g, b, a);
</pre>
        You will need to enter this and a similar definition for
        <code>lessGreen</code>, then write a new function similar
        to <code>squareDesign</code> that calls these functions in
        the appropriate places. Call this new function
        <code>colorDesign</code>, and test it (make sure the initial square
        has some red and green in it--for example,
        <code>showShapeList(colorDesign(100, 100, 40, white, 5))</code>).<br>
        
<img src="colorDesign.png" alt="showShapeList(colorDesign(100, 100, 40, white, 5))" width="382" height="382">
      </li>

      
<li>As a final problem, how could you change the code to draw
      the larger squares under the smaller squares, instead of
	  overlapping them? Whichever functions need to be modified, name
	  the new version by appending a <code>2</code>; for example, if
	  you modify <code>colorDesign</code>, then your new function
	  should be named <code>colorDesign2</code>.</li>
