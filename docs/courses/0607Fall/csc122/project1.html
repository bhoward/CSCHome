<h2>Project 1</h2>
	
		
<h3>Ramping up with Java - Reversi</h3>
		
<h3>Deadline: Friday, September 1, 5:00 p.m.</h3>

		
<dl>
			
<dt>Overview:</dt>
			
<dd>
<p>This project deals with the game of Reversi, also known as
			Othello.  It is played on an 8-by-8 checker board, with 64 pieces
			which are black on one side and white on the other.  Initially,
			the four center squares are covered with pieces, turned to white on
			one diagonal and black on the other.  The two players, black and white,
			then take turns placing one piece of their color at a time on an empty
			square of the board.  Any pieces of the opposite color which form a
			contiguous line (horizontal, vertical, or diagonal) bounded at one end
			by the new piece and at the other by another piece of the same color
			are then flipped over to the player's color.  Each turn must result in
			at least one of the opponent's pieces being flipped; if there is
			nowhere that a player can put a piece, their turn is skipped.  The game
			ends when neither player can play; the winner is the one with the most
			pieces turned to their color.</p>
			
			
<p>Your task will be to implement two strategies for this game: a
			<i>greedy</i> approach which chooses the move that flips the most
			pieces, and a <i>priority</i> approach which searches the squares in
			a fixed priority order and chooses the first legal move.</p>
			
</dd>

			
<dt>Specification:</dt>
			
<dd>
<ul>
				
<li>You will need a <code>Board</code> class which maintains the
				state of the board.  It will contain an 8-by-8 array of type
				<code>char</code>, where each cell can be <code>'.'</code>,
				<code>'B'</code>, or <code>'W'</code>.  It should provide the
				following methods:
				<ul>
				    
<li>
<code>void reset()</code>: clear the board and place the
				    initial four pieces.</li>
				    
<li>
<code>int checkMove(char player, java.awt.Point position)</code>:
				    return the number of opposing pieces which would be flipped by
				    the given player (<code>'B'</code> or <code>'W'</code>) playing
				    at the given position (where <code>(0,0)</code> is at the upper-left
				    and <code>(7,7)</code> is at the lower-right).  If the move is
				    not legal, return 0.</li>
				    
<li>
<code>boolean makeMove(char player, java.awt.Point position)</code>:
				    change the board to reflect the given move (note that <code>checkMove</code>
				    does <i>not</i> change the board), and return <code>true</code>.  If the move
				    is not legal (that is, if <code>checkMove</code> would have returned 0), leave
				    the board unchanged and return <code>false</code>.</li>
				    
<li>
<code>int count(char player)</code>: return how many of the given player's
				    pieces are currently face up on the board.</li>
				    
<li>
<code>void display()</code>: print the board on <code>System.out</code>.
				    For example, here is the result of calling <code>display()</code> right
				    after <code>reset()</code>:
				    <pre>
........
........
........
...BW...
...WB...
........
........
........
				    </pre>
</li>
				
</ul>
</li>
				
				
<li>You will need a <code>GreedyStrategy</code> class which implements the
				greedy strategy.  It should provide the following methods:
				<ul>
				    
<li>
<code>GreedyStrategy(char player, Board board)</code>: the constructor
				    simply saves in fields the color of its player (<code>'B'</code> or <code>'W'</code>)
				    and a reference to the <code>Board</code> on which the game will be played.</li>
				    
<li>
<code>java.awt.Point move()</code>: returns the best position at which this
				    player should place a piece on the current board, determined by which position
				    will result in the greatest number of opposing pieces flipped.  If there are no
				    legal moves, then return the point <code>(0,0)</code>.</li>
				
</ul>
</li>

				
<li>You will need a <code>PriorityStrategy</code> class which implements the
				priority strategy.  It should provide the following methods:
				<ul>
				    
<li>
<code>PriorityStrategy(char player, Board board)</code>: the constructor
				    saves in fields the color of its player (<code>'B'</code> or <code>'W'</code>)
				    and a reference to the <code>Board</code> on which the game will be played.  It
				    should also initialize a list of points in order of priority.  This order will
				    be up to you -- for example, you might want to put the four corners at the top
				    of the list, since they are very good cells to control (note that once you take
				    a corner, it can never be flipped).</li>
				    
<li>
<code>java.awt.Point move()</code>: returns the first position which has a
				    legal move, searched in priority order.  If there are no
				    legal moves, then return the point <code>(0,0)</code>.</li>
				
</ul>
</li>
				
				
<li>Finally, you will need a <code>Driver</code> class which has a <code>play()</code>
				method.  This should construct a <code>Board</code> object, a <code>GreedyStrategy</code> for
				black, and a <code>PriorityStrategy</code> for white, and then play a game of reversi.
				That is, it should reset the board, then alternate asking each strategy for a move and
				making that move.  It should print out the move and the state of the board after each
				turn.  When neither player can move (<code>makeMove</code> has returned <code>false</code>
				two times in a row), the game ends; the player with the higher piece count is the winner.</li>
			
</ul>

<dt>The Project and Getting Started:</dt>
			
<dd>
				
<p>
<strong>Standards:</strong>
</p>
				
<p>Your project should be well-written, neatly-formatted, modular,
					and well-documented.  I suggest you use a test-driven approach to
					implementation: first create the classes and method stubs, next write
					appropriate tests for each method, and then fill in the bodies of
					the methods to make the tests succeed.</p>
					
				
<p>You may work in pairs or individually.  Please review the policies on collaboration
					in the syllabus -- in particular, if you submit work developed as a pair, you need
					to make sure that you and your partner both understand all of the code submitted.</p>
					
				
<p>To submit your project, put all of the source files in an appropriately-named folder
					within <code>I:\10607_CSC122\</code> and <a href="mailto:bhoward@depauw.edu">send me an email</a>
					telling me where to find the files and, in the case of a pair, who your partner was.</p>

				
<p>
<strong>Grading:</strong>
</p>
				
<ul>
					
<li>
<code>Board</code> constructor and <code>reset</code> method (10 points)</li>
					
<li>
<code>checkMove</code> and <code>makeMove</code> methods (20 points)</li>
					
<li>
<code>count</code> and <code>display</code> methods (10 points)</li>
					
<li>
<code>GreedyStrategy</code> class (10 points)</li>
					
<li>
<code>PriorityStrategy</code> class (15 points)</li>
					
<li>Appropriate priority list of cells -- document your reasoning (5 points)</li>
					
<li>
<code>Driver</code> class (15 points)</li>
					
<li>Documentation and style (15 points)</li>					
				
</ul>
				
<p>For extra credit, add functionality so that a human player can compete against one
				of the computer strategies.  Also, I am planning to hold a tournament among all of the
				submissions, with 5 points of extra credit going to the winning strategy.</p>
