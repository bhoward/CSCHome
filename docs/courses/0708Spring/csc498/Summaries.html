<h2>Project Summaries</h2>

		
<dl>
			
<dt>Chad Byers, "PIPES: Peer-centric Interactive Programming Enhanced by Seeing"</dt>
			
<dd>
				
<p>
					The aim of this project is to develop a visual programming
					language (PIPES) and supporting development environment to
					enhance student understanding of the fundamental concepts
					and processes involved in programming languages. PIPES
					(Peer-centric Interactive Programming Enhanced by Seeing) is
					designed to model program "flow" through visual abstraction
					where elements of the language are represented graphically
					by a network of pipes and regulating mechanisms similar to
					those controlling water flow. Due to the diversity in
					programming languages, this visual programming language will
					focus on including a subset of the features inherent in
					languages such as Java and C++, languages which are standard
					in introductory computer science curriculum. Features of
					these languages that will be supported include primitive
					data types, operators, iterative processes, control
					structures, and functions/procedures.
				</p>
				
<p>
					A student using this visual language will be able to define
					his/her own programs by connecting the predefined
					programming structures and &ldquo;filling in&rdquo; missing information
					such as parameters, conditions, assignment values, and other
					necessary information and once he/she is finished the
					program will run line-by-line through the program for
					students to understand the changing state and flow of the
					program. A capability will also exist to translate the
					student&rsquo;s PIPES program into a supporting language such as
					Java or C++.
				</p>
			
</dd>
			
<dt>Adam Davis, "SHARP: Scheduling Helper And Relevant Peripherals"</dt>
			
<dd>
				
<p>
					SHARP is a calendar and checklist program with a detailed
					3-D user interface. The calendar will contain a daily
					scheduler, in which users can designate different tasks for
					each day. These tasks can be of different types, such as
					homework, classes, meetings, etc., and these types of tasks
					can be created by the user. Each day will also contain a
					level of fullness, which will be represented by a color
					scale with different color values for an empty day through a
					completely full day. SHARP will also have a checklist
					function, where the user can create multiple to-do lists,
					and add as many items as they want to each list. The heart
					of this project will be the user interface, available in 3-D
					and 2-D alternatives. In the 3-D view, each of the
					navigations between dates and checklists will be accompanied
					with animation and movement.
				</p>
			
</dd>
			
<dt>Ben Froemling, "User Assisted Graphical Analysis"</dt>
			
<dd>
				
<p>
					The purpose of this project is to allow a user to define
					graphs and then perform functions upon those graphs. The
					defining of a graph is done through a graphical user
					interface which allows the user to visually construct the
					graph using nodes and edges. Some of the functions supported
					will be the ability to construct minimum spanning trees from
					any given node, group color the graph, and also test for
					Eulerean properties within the graph. The culmination of the
					project will be to implement some of the tests for
					properties known to exist within Hamiltonian graphs.
				</p>
			
</dd>
			
<dt>Christine Lewellen, "Complex Parsing"</dt>
			
<dd>
				
<p>
					For my senior project, I will be developing a parser that
					uses a simplified English grammar to drive a text-based
					game. Typically, a user controls a text-based game by
					inputting text commands in order to traverse a game board
					and solve numerous word or logic puzzles. Since the
					manipulation of the program is no longer within the spatial
					realm of "point and click," the complexity of the puzzles is
					dependent on the complexity of the controls. That is to say,
					the more sentences that the program can understand, the more
					interesting the game will be. To accomplish the appearance
					of language comprehension, the system will require a parser
					that uses a sophisticated grammar. Although I will not
					attempt to implement natural language processing, I will use
					a context free grammar that can accept command sentences up
					to eight words in length. These may consist of verbs, direct
					objects, prepositions, conjunctions, adjectives or indirect
					objects.
				</p>
			
</dd>
			
<dt>Emily Lyons, "PHASE OUT:  A User vs. Computer Rummy-based Card Game"</dt>
			
<dd>
				
<p>
					My idea is to create a card game, which is similar to a game
					called Phase 10. Phase 10 involves collecting sets and runs
					in a 108-card deck (composed of numbered cards from 1-12 and
					special Wild and Skip cards) to complete 10 phases. My
					version of the game, called Phase Out, can be played by only
					two players (the computer and the user) and will eliminate
					the use of Skip cards. The primary goal for my project is to
					design a computer player with the ability to not only play
					the game by the rules, but also strategize by observing the
					actions of the user player. By knowing this, the computer
					can then base its own actions on their ability to help or
					hinder the user player&rsquo;s current strategy.

<dt>Corinne McWilliams, "Japanese Character Learning Program"</dt>
			
<dd>
				
<p>
					For my project I would like to write an educational program
					that recognizes Japanese characters. It will allow users to
					improve their skills in drawing the first 10 numeric Kanji
					and the 46 characters of the Hiragana writing system. The
					program will prompt the user to draw one of these
					characters. It will then compare the user&rsquo;s input to a
					sample image of that character and either acknowledge it as
					correct handwriting or give the user suggestions for
					improvement such as "your cross-stroke should be straighter"
					or "you should make the curve more rounded".
				</p>
			
</dd>
			
<dt>Kellie Packwood, "CRATE TRAINING: A Game for Learning Chinese Radicals"</dt>
			
<dd>
				
<p>
					My project will be a graphical game to introduce around
					fifteen Chinese character radicals. Radicals are used in
					Chinese and Japanese Kanji writing systems. They are smaller
					versions of commonly used characters that when combined with
					other characters form new words. Thus, recognizing key
					radicals is crucial to basic literacy.
				</p>
				
<p>
					The premise of Crate Training is you are a cat stuck in a
					shipping crate bound for China. The radicals will be
					presented in a list, with the Pinyin, or Latin
					transliteration, also supplied. While in the shipping crate,
					you will encounter ten scenarios that represent a radical
					each. Five radicals will be linked to bonuses or items to
					make a level easier but will not be required to complete a
					level. For example, the water radical will be used in the
					Thirsty scenario where the cat is running out of water and
					must find the water bottle crate before the time is up. Each
					level&rsquo;s difficulty will be determined by the amount of time
					(in seconds), with the lower level scenarios allowing for
					more time in selection. If a player fails to select the
					right box, it is considered a failed attempt and the level
					scenario will repeat again. Each failed attempt will cost
					the cat three lives, and when nine lives are spent, the game
					is over.

<dt>Kelsey Warsinske, "Interactive Statistics Learning Tool"</dt>
			
<dd>
				
<p>
					For my senior project I plan to build an interactive
					learning tool in Visual Basic that is comprised of tutorials
					on various aspects of Statistics. Furthermore I will also
					use a database to store much of the information required for
					the tutorials. The goal of this project is to teach
					Statistics to students with little or no knowledge of the
					subject. The target users will therefore be high school and
					college students with minimal to no statistics experience.
					The topics covered in the program will range from simpler
					concepts such as the difference between the mean, median,
					and mode to statistical sampling and computing z-scores and
					t-scores. Students will learn by clicking on various buttons
					within the user interface, which will allow them to navigate
					through the program by reading definitions, doing tutorials
					with sample data sets, learning about statistical sampling,
					and playing simple statistical games. To make this project
					as appealing to the target audience as possible, I will
					conduct a usability study with high school students in a
					statistics class to see what they would find most beneficial
					from a project of this type.
