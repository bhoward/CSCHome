<h3>Mining Data from Web Logs<br>
 Deadline: 5:00pm, Thursday, May 12</h3>

<dl>
<dt>Description</dt>

<dd>
<p>After many years of working with computers, Professor X, a
Computer Scientist at a small midwestern college, recently went off
of the deep end, deciding to give it all up and go on the road
playing banjo as a member of a bluegrass band. Expecting to gain
little income from his new venture, he has an unusual and
innovative idea for a business on the Web, a new dot-com, that will
essentially run itself, allowing him ample time for his new
pursuit.</p>

<p>He is keeping his idea a secret, but figures that if he is able
to easily monitor web activity he will be able to make minor
changes to the web site to keep the business going. There are
several places that web activity data are stored, one of them being
the Web Log. He has a list of reports that he would like to
generate and, because of your experience analyzing web logs, thinks
you are the person to write the software application that will
allow him to do so.</p>

<p>Since it has been a while since you actually worked with a web
log, here is a description of the log entries you will be
examining:</p>

<pre>
207.46.98.33 - - [01/Nov/2004:04:28:32 -0500] "GET /~runner/csc121/resources.htm HTTP/1.0" 200 3973
</pre>

<ul>
<li><code>207.46.98.33</code> is the IP address of the client
(e.g., Internet Explorer) which made this request of the web
server</li>

<li><code>- -</code> are always dashes in this log, but otherwise
could contain information about the client, such as userid</li>

<li><code>[01/Nov/2004:04:28:32 -0500]</code> is the time the
server finished processing the request. The format is always the
same: <code>[dd/mmm/yyyy:hh:mm:ss (+ or -)zzzz]</code></li>

<li><code>"GET /~runner/csc121/resources.htm HTTP/1.0"</code> is
the actual request from the client. <code>GET</code> is the method
used, <code>/~runner/csc121/resources.htm</code> is the requested
web page, and <code>HTTP/1.0</code> is the protocol used by the
client</li>

<li><code>200</code> is the status code sent to the client from the
server. Codes beginning in 2 indicate the page was successfully
delivered to the client; codes beginning in 4 indicate an error
caused by the client (a non-existant page was requested, for
example)</li>

<li><code>3973</code> is the size of the page returned to the
client</li>
</ul>

<p>Notice that each item above is separated from the other by a
space. Note also that some of the items themselves contain spaces.
If you were to read a line from the log file, one way to split the
line into pieces would be to use the split method, as in
line.split(" "). Then you would get an array of Strings with 10
elements, element 0 being "207.46.98.33", elements 1 and 2 both
being "-", element 3 being "[01/Nov/2004:04:28:32" and so on.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Items to do and point distribution:</dt>

<dd>
<p>Professor X would like the following information, for the time
period spanned by the log, included in a report written to a text
file:</p>

<ul>
<li>The number of distinct visitors (client ip addresses) to the
web site</li>

<li>The visitor who made the largest number of requests over all
visits</li>

<li>The most requested page</li>

<li>The peak hour of the day, for each of the nine days</li>

<li>The peak day</li>
</ul>

<p>The format of the report is up to you, but it should have a
title and each of the requested statistics should be appropriately
labeled and easily readable.</p>

<p><strong>Copy the project</strong>
<code>I:\CSC121\public\webanalyzer</code> to your own folder. The
project has several classes including one called Analyzer. This is
an empty class which you will need to write from scratch for this
assignment. Analyzer will have three main methods, input(Infile
inf), process(), and output(Outfile outf). Each of these are
described below. You are likely to decide to define "helper"
methods in addition to these three. A driver class will be calling
your methods, so they need to have the prescribed interface and
functionality.</p>

<p><strong>The project folder also contains a web log,</strong>
<code>access_logcps.txt</code>. This log has nine days worth of
data, November 1 - November 9, 2004.</p>

<p><strong>public boolean input(Infile inf)</strong> - This method
will use the read method of the Infile class (see that class
interface) to add web log records to an ArrayList. The ArrayList
will serve as a basis for analysis to be done by the process
method. Each line of the input is a String and contains a full log
record as described above. input() should return true or false
according to whether an ArrayList of length greater than zero has
been successfully constructed. After reading the last line from the
input, you should close() the input file.</p>

<p><strong>public void process()</strong> - This method will
construct, populate and prepare the structures required for
analysis. For example in order to compute the peak day and hour
statistic, you will likely construct a 2-D array of frequency
counts of visits, day x hour (9 x 24). You might want to use the
method parseInt from the Integer class to convert a String to an
int. You should extract day and hour from the time field of the web
log entry. The syntax for using the function is:</p>

<pre>
int myInt = Integer.parseInt( &lt;The String to convert&gt; );
       
</pre>

<p><strong>public void output(Outfile outf)</strong> - This method
will use the write method of the Outfile class (see that class
interface) to create a text file containing the results of the
analysis. You should use the structures created by the process
method to produce your report.You might want to produce the report
in a terminal window before writing it to a text file. You should
close the output file after writing the last line of output.</p>

<ol>
<li>(15 points) Correct implementation of the input() method.</li>

<li>(15 points) Correct implementation of the output() method.</li>

<li>(15 points) Correct implementation of the process method and
the associated structures.</li>

<li>(10 points) The correct number of distinct visitors (client ip
addresses) to the web site.</li>

<li>(10 points) The correct visitor who made the largest number of
requests and the visit count for this visitor.</li>

<li>(10 points) The correct most requested page and its request
count.</li>

<li>(10 points) The correct peak hour report and visit count for
each of the nine days in the log.</li>

<li>(10 points) The correct peak day and visit count.</li>

<li>(5 points) Programming style, formatting (readability), and
comments, especially describing methods.</li>
</ol>
</dd>

<dt>Turning in your project:</dt>

<dd>When you are finished, copy your project to the appropriate
folder under <code>I:\CSC121\Project5</code> and send an email
message to your instructor naming the members (1 or 2) of your
team.</dd>
