<h1>CSC 121: Computer Science I, Spring 2005</h1>

<h2>Project 1</h2>

<h3>A Graphics Satellite Rescue Simulation<br>
 Deadline: 5:00pm, Monday, March 7</h3>

<p style="color: red"><strong><em>Alert:</em> Someone from your
team of ten people has reported to us that your prototype is ready
for delivery to NASA. We have reviewed it and found that several
things are missing, some things have been implemented incorrectly,
and we have some specification changes requested by NASA. Since the
above deadline is rapidly approaching, it is your responsibility as
the two lead programmers to make all of these changes on behalf of
your whole team.</strong></p>

<p>Please review the original specification below and then make the
following changes <strong>(Note: You should not modify any of the
base classes - Canvas, Circle, Triangle, or Diamond. You will need
to modify each of the other classes to some degree.)</strong>:</p>

<ul>
<li>(5 pts) NASA is not pleased with the magenta color of the space
shuttle. Change it to more of a NASA color of your choosing.</li>

<li>(10 pts) The space shuttle is anchored in the middle of the
window and can only move in the downward direction. The
specification calls for the shuttle to be anchored at the left side
of the window and that upward movement be possible by typing the
'K' key.</li>

<li>(5 pts) The fuel cell is initially visible and hanging alone in
space. It should not be visible initially and should have an
initial position that is not likely to intersect with the space
station (the bottom left corner of the window, for example).</li>

<li>(10 pts) The specification calls for three speed options, B, I,
and A. Your team used A, B, and C. Make this change and the
corresponding change to the label at the top of the window.</li>

<li>(10 pts) The specification called for the space station to
begin an orbit at random position at the top of the window. It
always begins a new orbit at the same position.</li>

<li>(20 pts) The specification requires that no more than 3 fuel
cells can be used in any fueling attempt. This was not implemented.
The specification has been slightly modified. The shuttle will
carry 5 fuel cells and will keep track of how many it has launched.
After all 5 have been launched, the shuttle simply watches as the
space station hurls toward earth and crashes. The 3 second wait
upon crash does seem to be working.</li>

<li>(20 pts) A new specification has been requested for handling a
successful docking of the fuel cell with the space station. Rather
than the space station turning green and waiting for 3 seconds
before starting a new orbit, the following should occur. The fuel
cell will become invisible. The shuttle will travel toward the
space station on the same path as the fuel cell (a while loop),
dock with the space station as the fuel cell did, wait 3 seconds
and then travel back to the left side of the window. Then the space
station will turn green and a new orbit will begin. You can look to
see how the fuel cell recognizes that it has met the space station
to complete this feature. To do this you should write a docking
method for the shuttle. The method should have 2 parameters, namely
the x and y coordinates of the station. Invoke the docking method
from the fuel cell object.</li>

<li>(10 pts) Finally, the fuel cell never disappears when it
reaches the right side of the window or after refueling, as it
should.</li>

<li>(10 pts) Programming style, formatting (readability), and
comments, especially describing methods.</li>
</ul>

<h3>The Original Specification</h3>

<dl>
<dt>Overview:</dt>

<dd>
<p>NASA has a tentative contract with your software company,
National Enterprise for Rescue Deployment Simulation (NERDS) to
create a space station refueling simulation that will be used by
NASA personnel as a training tool. Your company has promised to
deliver a prototype of the simulation by Friday, February 25. If
the prototype is successful, your company will receive the full
contract worth 2.5 million dollars.</p>

<p>The simulation will have a space shuttle launch a fuel cell,
which will dock with an orbiting space station. Because of a low
fuel supply, the space station has entered a state of unplanned
orbital descent and will eventually crash into the earth if it does
not receive a new supply of fuel soon.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Prototype specification:</dt>

<dd>
<p><b>Choosing level of difficulty:</b> The simulation will provide
an option for selecting a level of difficulty, beginner (B),
intermediate (I), or advanced (A). The level determines the speed
at which the space station is orbiting.</p>

<p><b>The Space Station:</b> The space station is a Diamond object.
It has a fueling port, namely the lowest vertex of the diamond.
Space station movement begins at a random horizontal location and a
vertical location of 0. To simulate orbiting, the space station
will move left to right on a downward sloping line across the
window disappearing on the right and reappearing on the left. Each
new orbit will begin at a slightly lower level that the previous
orbit. The color of the space station changes from green to yellow
after one orbit, indicating a low fuel supply.</p>

<p><b>The Space Shuttle:</b> The space shuttle will be a Triangle
located in the middle of the left side of the window with its base
always on the left window boundary and its nose pointing to the
right. The position of the shuttle can be adjusted slightly up or
down according to whether the 'J' or the 'K' key on the keyboard is
pressed. 'J' will cause the shuttle to move down and the 'K' key
will move the shuttle up. Up and down distance shifts will be the
same for each key. Pressing the space bar will launch a fuel cell,
a blue ball, from the space shuttle. The fuel cell will appear at
the nose of the shuttle and travel at a reasonable rate of speed
from the shuttle to the right side of the window on the horizontal
line passing through the shuttle's nose. If refueling is not
successful after three tries or if the space station reaches the
bottom of the window without refueling the space station crashes,
indicated by its color turning to red and no screen activity for
three seconds, after which the space station will initialize a
beginning orbit for another fueling attempt.</p>

<p><b>The fueling process:</b> If the fuel cell makes contact with
the fuel port of the space station, fueling will occur
automatically. The color of the space station will change to green,
there will be no screen activity for three seconds and then the
space station will begin a new orbit for another fueling attempt.
If the fuel cell misses the space station it simply disappears and
becomes a new piece of space junk.</p>

<p><b>Starting and stopping the simulation:</b> Pressing the 'S'
key will start the simulation and pressing the 'X' key will stop
it.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Turning in your project:</dt>

<dd>Copy your project to the appropriate folder(s) under the
Project-01 folder on the I: drive. Send an email message to your
instructor when you have done this, naming the programmer or pair
of programmers who completed the project.</dd>
