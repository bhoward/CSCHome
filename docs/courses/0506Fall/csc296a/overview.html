<dt>Course Description:</dt>
			
<dd>
				
<p>
					An in-depth study of the C++ programming language, directed
					towards students who are already comfortable in an
					imperative language (perhaps even C++) and who wish to
					explore the wide range of capabilities of modern C++. Topics
					covered will include pointers and memory management,
					inheritance and polymorphism, templates, exceptions,
					user-defined types and operators, and the use of the
					standard library, especially containers and streams.
				</p>
			
</dd>

			
<dt>Grading:</dt>
			
<dd>
				The grade for this course will be based on the following:
				<ul>
					
<li>35%: Programming projects</li>
					
<li>20%: Homework assignments and quizzes</li>
					
<li>
						20%: Midterm exam (Monday, September 19)
					</li>
					
<li>
						25%: Final exam (Monday, October 10)
					</li>
				
</ul>
				The grading scale used for this class will be the following: A
				(93-100), A- (90-92), B+ (87-89), B (83-86), B- (80-82), C+
				(77-79), C (73-76), C- (70-72), D+ (67-69), D (63-66), D-
				(60-62), F(0-59). I reserve the right to alter this grading
				scale at any time. The last day to withdraw from class is
				Wednesday, September 21.
			</dd>

			
<dt>Policy Statements:</dt>
			
<dd>
				
<ul>
					
<li>
						You are expected to attend all class sessions. However,
						I expect you to take your own education seriously, so I
						do not keep formal attendance records. If you miss a
						class, you are responsible for catching up with the
						material that was covered and any announcements that
						were made.
					</li>
					
<li>
						Homework assignments are due at the start of class and
						programming projects are due by 5 pm on the assigned
						date. Late submissions will be accepted until the next
						class time at a penalty of half the grade. Extensions
						will be considered
						<em>only</em>
						by prior arrangement.
					</li>
					
<li>
						Programming projects will be graded on style and
						efficiency as well as correct operation. To develop as a
						programmer, you are strongly encouraged to do more than
						the minimum assigned amount of work; the best way to
						learn good style and common idioms is to read and write
						lots of code.
					</li>
					
<li>
						Cheating, plagiarism, submission of the work of others,
						etc., violates the DePauw policy on academic integrity
						and may result in penalties ranging from a lowered grade
						to course failure or expulsion. The policy and
						discussion of each student's obligations and rights are
						in the Student Handbook.
					</li>
					
<li>
						With respect to this course, no collaboration is
						permitted on exams or quizzes. You may discuss homework
						problems and programming assignments with anyone you
						want (in fact, you are encouraged to do so), but you
						should not copy another student's work nor permit your
						work to be copied. The key idea is that you should
						<em>understand</em>
						all of the work you turn in, and you should be able to
						replicate it on your own. If you do not feel that you
						can replicate the work independently, then it is not
						fair (to yourself or to others) to submit it as your own
						work. If at any time you are uncertain what constitutes
						"appropriate" collaboration, it is your responsibility
						to clarify it with me.
					</li>
					
<li>
						Exams in this course will be open-book and
						open-notes, and will cover lectures and assigned
						readings. More information will be available prior to
						each exam.
					</li>
					
<li>
						During class time, the computer at your seat should be
						used for note-taking, classroom interaction, and
						in-class exercises. You are not permitted to read
						e-mail, browse the web, play games, etc. while class is
						in session.
					</li>
					
<li>
						This class will be using the C++ programming language.
						You may use your choice of IDEs (or no IDE at all), but the preferred
						choice will be the Visual Studio .NET development environment.  We have
						a site license which allows students to get a free copy of this if
						you want to install it on your own computer -- the disks are on reserve
						in Prevo Library (Windows only -- talk to me
						about Mac and Linux options). If you want to use some other
						environment, talk to me about it (before the assignment
						is due!).
					</li>
					
<li>
						Regrade requests will be entertained for up to one week
						after the assignment or exam is returned to the student.
						To request a regrade, please write out on a separate
						sheet of paper your request and attach it to the
						assignment or exam, and give it to me. A simple request
						for more points without a justification is not
						sufficient! Keep in mind that the entire assignment or
						exam may be regraded, so carefully consider your
						requests!
					</li>
					
<li>
						Please feel free to offer me feedback (positive and
						negative) about my performance or anything else related
						to the class. This feedback will have no effect on your
						grade in the class.
					</li>
					
<li>
						Reading assignments will be given in class. They will
						mostly consist of readings from the class textbook, but
						other handouts and papers may be assigned as well.
					</li>
					
<li>
						All information about the class, whether given in this
						handout or in class, is subject to change.
					</li>
