<h2>Welcome to CodeRuler!</h2>

<p>
CodeRuler gives you the opportunity to pit your Java programming skills against other teams
in a medieval world of conquest. Each team will write a Java class which represents and
controls a <I>MyRuler</I>. Your ruler (class) will be placed in a simulated battle along with
rulers from other teams.
</p>

<p>
The game pits rulers against each other in a series of matches. A match consists of up to 
six rulers competing with each other. Each ruler starts a match with one castle in a random
location on a finite two-dimensional grid of squares, with the same amount of peasants 
and knights as the other rulers. The task of a ruler is to give orders to its peasants, knights,
and castles.
</p>

<p>
During each match, each ruler can accumulate “points.” Rulers can earn points in three ways:
by ordering peasants to claim land;
by ordering knights to capture peasants, knights, and castles of other rulers;
and by the number of their peasants, knights, and castles remaining at the end of the match.
Rulers with the highest point totals from each match advance to subsequent rounds.
</p>

<p>
The simulator shows each match on the screen. Knights appear as horse heads, and peasants appear as
small stars. The scenery (e.g. lake, mountains, sky, and castle images) does not affect the
movement of peasants or knights in any way.

On the right hand side of the screen there will be information about the rulers competing in the match.
For each ruler there is a console showing its name, school name, current score (points gained
so far during the current match), and the total units of land it currently owns.
There is a clock at the bottom right that makes one complete revolution for each match.
To exit the match at any time, click the red X in the upper right hand corner of the screen.
</p>

<p>
The rest of this guide shows how to create a ruler and how to invoke its capabilities.
You should now try to understand the code structure that your ruler must implement, and discuss
the strategy for your ruler to use during the game. It is permissible for you to openly discuss code
structure and strategy during this time, even with other teams.
</p>

<p>
The coding phase of the CodeRuler starts when you get access to your machine. You will use the Eclipse
development environment to create and test your ruler. You must use Eclipse to develop your ruler 
code, since the simulated world runs under Eclipse. During this phase you may not talk to other teams.
</p>

<p>
You can test your ruler during the coding phase in two ways. First, there will be a private version
of the world on your machine. The private world contains a collection of sample rulers
with various capabilities (but no rulers from other teams). You may run your ruler in this private 
world to see how it performs. Only you will be able to see the results of running your ruler in the private 
world.
</P>

<p>
The second way to test your ruler is to submit it to the public CodeRuler world. When you 
submit your ruler to the public world, you will obtain a snapshot on your machine 
of all other rulers that have been submitted up to that point in time. You will be 
able to run a public version of the CodeRuler world to watch the performance of your ruler 
against other players' submitted rulers (and vice versa).
</p>

<p>
The performance of your ruler in the public world during the coding phase is strictly an
opportunity for you to see how your ruler performs against other player's rulers in order
to consider making changes.
</p>

<p>
It is not a requirement to submit your ruler to the public world during the coding phase. However, 
all teams must submit their final rulers prior to the end of the coding phase to be included in
the final tournament.</P>

<p>
The final versions of all rulers (the last submission you make) will compete in a tournament which
will take place during the IBM Java Challenge dinner tonight. The rulers will initially be
grouped randomly into matches with up to five other rulers. After each round, rulers will be regrouped
according to the points they have accumulated, and a new round will begin.</P>

<p>
All rulers will compete in at least three rounds. After that, 
eliminations will take place based on points and a new series of rounds will 
begin. Each ruler will start each new series of rounds with zero points and random regrouping.
The team whose ruler earns the most points in the final tournament 
round will be the winning team.
</p>

<p>
The remainder of this guide is intended to help you understand how to design and implement your ruler.
JavaDoc files are also available, describing the classes and interfaces that relate to coding your ruler.
</p>

<p><center><b>Good luck in CodeRuler!</b></center></p>

<h2>Coding Your Ruler – Overview</h2>

<p>When you start Eclipse on your machine and open the CodeRuler project, you will find a skeleton for the class
<span class="code">MyRuler</span>. This is the class that will contain the code making up your ruler.
You may add fields and declare additional methods, use inner classes, and create other Java classes.</P>

<p>The MyRuler class contains stubs for methods required in rulers; you will have to fill 
in the code in these methods. Modifying these methods is the primary manner in which you create the 
“personality” of your ruler. You may also add other fields and methods to the MyRuler class or make
use of other facets of the Java language to further define its characteristics.</p>

<p>When you have a version of the MyRuler class that you want to test in the private world, save your MyRuler
code and then click the “Run against samples” button on the Eclipse toolbar 

(<img src="../images/test.gif" width=16 height=16 hspace=1 vspace=1/>).

If you are not sure about the function of an icon, move the mouse over it to see a ToolTip.
</p>

<p>
To submit your MyRuler to the public world, save your code and click the “Submit code” button on 
the Eclipse toolbar

(<img src="../images/submit.gif" width=16 height=16 hspace=1 vspace=1/>).
</p>

<p>
When you submit your code, an encyrpted copy of all other teams' current submissions will be downloaded to
your machine. This enables you to test and view your performance against the other teams' submissions. 
To do this, you can now click on the “Run against other teams” button, which has the following icon:

<img src="../images/tournament.gif" width=16 height=16 hspace=1 vspace=1/>.

</p>
If you have not yet successfully submitted code, or if you are the first team to submit code, the Opponent
selection list will be empty.
You may submit your code as often as you want; this is the only way to get fresh copies of the code
from other team's to test against. Your last submission will be the one used in the final tournament.
</p>

<p>
The class <a href="javadoc/com/ibm/ruler/Ruler.html">Ruler</a> is the superclass of MyRuler.
It defines several methods that are inherited by MyRuler. These methods can be extremely useful
in building your ruler.
</p>

<p>
Do not modify anything in the Ruler class. When you run your ruler,
it will actually run with a different version of the Ruler class from the one you
see in your environment. In particular, the Ruler
class you will see contains some dummy initialization and return value code that 
will be replaced when you run in the private or public world.
</p>

<p>
In addition to the above classes, your environment will contain five Java interfaces that
define the interfaces presented by various components of the game, as well as a helper
class:
</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="javadoc/com/ibm/ruler/IObject.html">IObject.java</a>
<p/>
<p>
This is the interface of all objects in the simulated battle. Every object implements this 
interface, which declares methods getX() and getY() 
that return the location of the object in the world. All coordinates are non-negative 
values of type int.
</p>
</li>

<li><a href="javadoc/com/ibm/ruler/IPeasant.html">IPeasant.java</a>
<p>
This interface extends IObject and defines the interface of all peasants that are currently active in the 
simulation. Every peasant implements this interface.
Peasants can claim land to get points for your ruler. Each time a peasant enters a new square, it claims
that square for its ruler.
</p>
</li>

<li><a href="javadoc/com/ibm/ruler/IKnight.html">IKnight.java</a>
<p>
This interface extends IObject and defines the interface of all knights that are currently active in the 
simulation. Every knight implements this interface.
Knights do not claim land, but they can capture peasants, knights, and castles.
</p>
</li>

<li><a href="javadoc/com/ibm/ruler/ICastle.html">ICastle.java</a>
<p>
This interface extends IObject and defines the interface of all castles that are currently active in the 
simulation. Every castle implements this interface.
Castles produce more peasants or knights for your ruler at a rate depending on the amount of land
the ruler owns.
</p>
</li>

<li><a href="javadoc/com/ibm/ruler/IRuler.html">IRuler.java</a>
<p>
This defines the interface for all other rulers in the match. It allows you to find out which
objects (peasants, knights, and castles) belong to each ruler. These
methods are described in further detail below and in the JavaDocs for the CodeRuler environment.
</p>
</li>

<li><a href="javadoc/com/ibm/ruler/World.html">World.java</a>
<p>
This helper class provides static methods for the CodeRuler world. You can find out who the
other rulers are, and how many peasants and knights they each have.
These methods are described in further detail below and in the JavaDocs for the CodeRuler environment.
</p>
</li>

</ul>

<h2>The CodeRuler Simulation</h2>
<h3>Identification</h3>
<p>
There are two method stubs in the MyRuler class that your team must fill in to identify your ruler.
The first is getSchoolName(), which must return a string of no more than 25 characters giving the name of your 
School or University. Teams that do not assign their school name in getSchoolName() will not be allowed to
compete in the tournament.
</p>

<p>
The second required method is getRulerName(), which must return a string of no more
than 25 characters assigning a name to your ruler. You may choose any name
you wish for your ruler, but inappropriate names may be modified or the ruler may be eliminated.
</p>

<p>
The identification methods must not do any computations other than returning the specified strings.
</p>

<h3>Initialization</h3>
<p>
When your ruler is placed into the world, the simulator invokes the initialize() method in your ruler.
Put any initialization code you want to have executed into this method. You may make use of the entire
API at this time. Be aware that the simulator will provide only a limited amount of time (1 second) for
your initialization code to execute before it begins the game. If your initialization code fails to 
complete within the time limit, your ruler will enter the world in an uninitialized state, with
unpredictable results.
</p>

<h3>Moving Your Objects</h3>
<p>
Once the simulator finishes its timed calls to each ruler’s 
initialize() routine, it calls the orderSubjects() method of each ruler in sequential 
order. This happens once every turn. The code in your ruler’s orderSubjects()
method determines what actions your ruler takes during the course of a game.
Methods are available on your ruler to query 
its status, on the World class to query the status of other rulers, and to find the location of 
objects (for example, your opponent's knights and castles).
</p>

<p>
To move your knights, peasants, and castles, use the move(), capture(), createPeasants() or createKnights()
methods on your ruler. Each turn, you should call these methods for each object that you control
to let it know what to do. For instance, to tell your first knight to move east, you would call:
move(getKnights()[0], MOVE_E).
</p>

<p>
orderSubjects() has one parameter. It is the time (in milliseconds) that your orderSubjects() method
used the previous time it was called. Since there is a limited amount of time allowed to make each turn,
this parameter is useful in determining whether your ruler is in danger of exceeding the maximum amount
of time.
</p>

<h3>CodeRuler Details</h3>
<p>
A CodeRuler world is a two-dimensional world of 72 units in X by 64 units in Y, <i>with the origin in the top left 
corner</i>. There is a wall around the outside edge of the world, and objects cannot go beyond the wall.
Objects can move freely about the world, unless they bump into another object.
</p>
<p>
The figure below describes the world:
</p>

<img src="world.png" width=270 height=209 hspace=10 vspace=10/>

<p/>

<p>
The world has the following characteristics:</p>
<ul>
<li>The world is driven by a ticking clock whose value is World.getCurrentTurn(). The
total (maximum) number of turns in each match is defined by the World.MAX_TURNS constant.
</li>

<li>Each ruler starts the match with 10 peasants, 10 knights, and 1 castle.</li>

<li>Every peasant, knight, and castle takes up exactly one square unit. Two of these objects
cannot share the same position.
</li>

<li>Each peasant and knight can move one unit each turn. They can move only into an empty square
(i.e. one that is not already occupied by another object).
</li>

<li>Peasants can claim land. Every time a peasant enters a square of land that is not already
claimed by its ruler, that land becomes claimed (owned) by the peasant's ruler. This land will
remain claimed
for the rest of the game, unless another ruler's peasant enters that square. To move a peasant, call
move(IPeasant, int), where the int parameter indicates the move direction. The valid moves for a peasant
are all of the 8 MOVE_xx constants that can move
the peasant in any direction to an empty, adjacent square (see figure below for the directions).
If the square is out of bounds or is occupied, the peasant will do nothing.
<p/>

<img src="directions.png" width=159 height=134 hspace=10 vspace=10/>
</li>

<li>Knights can be used to capture other objects. The basic movements for knights are the same as
peasants (although knights cannot claim land). Knights can move in any of the 8 directions using
move(IKnight, int). However, knights can also capture opposing peasants, knights, and castles that
are in any of the 8 adjacent squares. This is done by calling capture(IKnight, int), using the
same MOVE_xx constants as for moving. If the adjacent square is empty, the knight will do nothing.
If the square contains a peasant, the peasant will be captured and removed from the game.
<p/>

Each knight starts with 100 strength. If the square that it is trying to capture contains another
knight, that other knight's strength will be reduced by a random number
between 15 and 30. If the knight has reached 0 strength, it will be captured and removed from the game,
and the winning knight will gain 20 strength.
Even if the object is captured and removed from the game, the knight does not move into that location.
A knight cannot move and capture during the same turn; the latest order takes precedence.
</li>

<li>Castles continuously create new knights or peasants. Use createPeasants(ICastle) and
createKnights(ICastle) to tell your castle whether to create peasants or knights respectively. The latest
order will take precedence. Castles produce a new peasant or knight faster when the ruler has claimed
more land. The number of turns required to create each new peasant or knight are:

<table cellSpacing=5 cellPadding=1 border=0>
 <tr>
  <td><b>Owned land</b></td>
  <td><b>Turns required to produce one peasant or knight</b></td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>>4000</td>
  <td>4</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>2000</td>
  <td>6</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>1000</td>
  <td>8</td>

 <tr>
  <td>500</td>
  <td>10</td>

  <td>250</td>
  <td>12</td>

  <td>125</td>
  <td>14</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td><125</td>
  <td>will not produce</td>
 </tr>
</table>
</li>

<li>Knights can also capture castles. The castle's flag
will be changed accordingly and your ruler can now order the castle to start producing peasants
or knights. Each additional castle increases your ability to produce more peasants and knights.
Capturing a second castle will allow you to produce peasants or knights at twice the speed,
or produce peasants in one castle and knights in the other castle.
</li>

<li>If no move is given to a knight or peasant during your turn, they will remain in the same location
and not do anything.</li>

<li>The time limit to complete a single orderSubjects() move is 500 milliseconds. If a ruler's
orderSubjects() method
does not return within 500 milliseconds of the time when it is called, the orderSubjects() will not be
called again for the rest of the match and no further moves will be made by that ruler's objects.</li>

<li>Points are earned according to the following table. Remember that it is total points earned that
determines which rulers advance during elimination rounds.

<table cellSpacing=5 cellPadding=1 border=0>
 <tr>
  <td><b>Action</b></td>
  <td><b>Points Earned</b></td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Each peasant captured by a knight</td>
  <td>4</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Each knight captured by a knight</td>
  <td>6</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Each castle captured by a knight</td>
  <td>15</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Claimed land at end of match</td>
  <td>1 point for every 10 squares</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Each peasant left at end of match</td>
  <td>1</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Each knight left at end of match</td>
  <td>2</td>
 </tr>
 <tr>
  <td>Each castle owned at end of match</td>
  <td>25</td>
 </tr>
</table>
</li>

</ul>

<h3>General Information, Caveats, Constraints, and Restrictions</h3>

<ul>

<li>The Java JRE being use for CodeRuler is version 1.4.2.</li>

<li>Rulers may not define any constructors.</li>

<li>Rulers may not include static initialization blocks in the class header.</li>

<li>Rulers may not create their own threads, processes, 
print jobs, files, AWT or Swing visual components, or other similar system functions.</li>

<li>Rulers may use System.out.println() to display information on the Eclipse console, but the time it takes to do this 
is charged against the ruler’s orderSubjects() time limit. (Actions like this are relatively time-consuming.)</li>

<li>You may run the simulation in Java debug mode. However, understand that when running either the 
private or public worlds in debug mode, all move and initialization time limits 
are automatically turned off to allow for breakpoints. If your moves are taking a long time, you should 
test your ruler in run mode to ensure that it is not going over the time limits.</li>

<li>You may not talk to anyone other than your own team members once the coding phase of the CodeRuler starts.</li>

<li>Any player that submits a ruler containing code deemed to be intentionally designed
to damage the CodeRuler environment will be disqualified.</li>

</ul>


<h2>Example MyRuler Code</h2>
<p>
The following code snippets show simple examples of various 
operations which might be used inside a orderSubjects() method. Note that <I>these are separate code snippets</I>, not a 
single complete orderSubjects() method or MyRuler class. Note also that these are only examples, intended to give you an
idea of how to do things within your ruler. Winning rulers will undoubtedly utilize sophisticated strategies
which take full advantage of the range of method calls available to them.
The code used in the sample rulers is not provided.
</p>

<p>
The list of methods available to rulers is documented in the JavaDoc descriptions of the classes and interfaces of
the CodeRuler environment. The primary challenge in the CodeRuler is for you to decide on a strategy which uses the
available methods to optimum advantage for your ruler.</p>
