<h2>Project 4</h2>
	
		
<h3>Decisions, decisions, decisions</h3>
		
<h3>Deadline: Wednesday, December 7, 5:00 p.m.</h3>

		
<dl>
			
<dt>Overview:</dt>
			
<dd> 
    
<p>A decision tree can be viewed as a flow chart or diagram representing a 
      classification system or predictive model. The tree is structured as a sequence 
      of questions, the answers to which trace a path down the tree to a leaf 
      containing the path's classification or prediction. The classification 
      or prediction made by the model can be a qualitative judgment (e.g., these 
      are responders) or a numerical forecast (e.g., sales will increase 15 percent). 
      Decision trees can be used in many ways, from mining data contained in very 
      large databases to making decisions in response to simple yes/no questions. 
      Decision trees can also "learn" by being extended when an incorrect 
      answer is found at the end of a path.</p>

    
<p>In this assignment you will have the opportunity to build, modify and use 
      binary decision trees. In the tree that you maintain, each internal node 
      is a yes/no question with two children. Leaves contain the results of traversing 
      the various paths. You are to write a Java application that learns about 
      the universe of your choice by asking the user yes/no questions. For example, 
      the program might learn about animals by having the following dialog with 
      its user (user responses are in uppercase; the actual project will communicate
      by using dialog boxes):</p>


<pre>
  Think of an animal and I will guess it.

  Does it have legs? YES
  Is it a cat? YES
  I win! Continue? YES

  Think of an animal and I will guess it.

  Does it have legs? NO
  Is it a snake? YES
  I win! Continue? YES

  Think of an animal and I will guess it.

  Does it have legs? NO
  Is it a snake? NO
  I give up. What is it? EARTHWORM
  Please type a question whose answer is yes for an earthworm and no for a snake:
    DOES IT LIVE UNDERGROUND?
  Continue? NO

  Good-bye
</pre>

    
<p>The next set of questions might lead to <b>Is it a snake?</b> To which 
      the answer might be no and the question to learn next might be <b>Does it 
      live in water?</b> resulting in another node being added to the tree:</p>
    
<div align="center">
<img src="tree.png" width="504" height="360" alt="Tree example"></div>
    
<p>It could also be the case that a result might need 
      to be deleted from the tree. For example, if <b>snake</b> is deleted then
      <b>fish</b> replaces the question <b>Does it live in water?</b>
</p>
    
<p>Finally, once a tree is built, it would be nice to have it persist between 
      the times the application is run. Thus the tree should be able to be saved 
      to a text file and rebuilt by reading that file when the application is 
      launched again.  In addition, it should be possible to save and load
      several different "knowledge bases" (decision trees).</p>

<dt>Specification:</dt>
	
<dd> 
	  
<p>
<b>The Guessing project</b> has at least four classes:</p>
	  
<ol>
	    
<li>
<b>Driver:</b> Contains the method <b>main</b>, which creates an instance 
	      of <b>GuessingGUI</b> and invokes its <b>start</b> method. <b>Driver</b> 
	      will be used to run the application stand-alone (not in the BlueJ environment) 
	      once you have completed the rest of the project. You should test as you 
	      go by using instances of <b>GuessingGUI</b>, <b>Game</b> and the other classes 
	      you write.</li>
	    
<li>
<b>GuessingGUI:</b> Contains code that creates a Graphical User Interface 
	      with components that are used to accomplish interaction with the application(see 
	      below). You should study this module carefully as it contains calls to methods 
	      corresponding to each of the buttons in the GUI. It also contains methods 
	      used by <b>Game:</b> to open a file for reading and for writing.</li>
	    
<li>
<b>Game:</b> Contains a minimal amount of uninteresting code corresponding 
	      to each of the buttons in the GUI.</li>
	    
<li>
<b>DTree:</b> Is a class not yet written. It contains instance variables 
	      and methods corresponding to a decision tree class. The tree will have nodes 
	      with left and right child references, as well as a String item in which to 
	      store a question or a result. The left reference will correspond to the 
	      decision YES and the right to the decision NO. You will need to provide 
	      methods to: visit the next node (based on YES or NO decision), write a tree 
	      to a text file, read and create a tree from a text file, and add a question 
	      and a result to the tree (the result will be a leaf). <b>You will receive
	      extra credit if you also implement the delete method described above.</b>
</li>
	    
<li>
<b>You may choose to write or include additional classes or methods; a 
	      DTreeNode class, for example.</b> For each such class and method make sure 
	      to provide complete documentation using JavaDoc format.</li>
	  
</ol>

<dt>The Project and Getting Started:</dt>
	
<dd> 
	  
<p>
<strong>The Guessing project:</strong>
</p>
	  
<ul>
	    
<li>The provided files can be copied from <code>I:\csc122x\public\Guessing</code>.</li>
	    
<li>Implement the project using the test-driven implementation strategy: first 
	      build a test system and stubbed implementation of each class.</li>
	    
<li>One strategy for saving a tree to a file is to write each node's item 
	      field as a separate line, doing so using a preorder traversal of the tree 
	      (recursive or otherwise). You will need to mark each leaf so that you can 
	      recognize them when restoring the tree. One way to do this is to write an 
	      empty string as a line in the file prior to writing the item in the leaf 
	      node. Don't forget to close the file when you are finished writing the tree.</li>
	    
<li>Restore a tree from a file by first reading the first line from the file 
	      (it will become the root) and building the rest of the tree knowing that it
	      is in preorder in the file. If you use the above approach, then when you
	      encounter an empty string you know 
	      that the next line from the file corresponds to a leaf, and you can create 
	      a node without any children accordingly. If you use recursion, the prototype 
	      for the helper method might be: <b>DTreeNode readTree(BufferedReader reader)</b>
</li>
	  
</ul>
	  
<p>
<strong>Standards:</strong>
</p>
	  
<p>Your project should be well-written, neatly-formatted, modular, and
	  well-documented.</p>
	  
<p>
<strong>Grading:</strong>
</p>
	  
<ul>
	    
<li>Correctly handling decision tree operations (48 points) 
	      <ul>
	        
<li>write a tree</li>
	        
<li>read a tree</li>
	        
<li>get next node</li>
