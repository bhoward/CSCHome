Fall 2004-2005 Semester</h1>

<h2>Project Summaries</h2>

<h3>Section A (Howard)</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Blake Bryan, "AudioEdit"</dt>
<dd>
<p>My project is going to be a program that allows the user to easily
create music with the computer.  MIDI sequences will be created using a
graphical representation of a keyboard, guitar strings, and drum pads.
MIDI sequencing hardware will also be used to interface with the
software to allow the user to use a more physical piece of equipment to
create music.  The sequences will be saved as files that can later be
converted to WAV files.  These WAV files will have effects that can be
added to them.  Multi-effects (many effects layered on top of each other)
will be able to be created and saved by the user.</p>

<p>At the completion of the software, I plan on creating a website that
will market the software and allow people to download a demo version.
Users will also be able to upload MIDI sequences, WAV files, and
multi-effects that they have created to share with other users.</p>

<dt>Chris Colvard, "Collaborative Perspective for Programming Language
Learning (CPPLL)"</dt>
<dd>
<p>This project's goal is to develop a plugin for the Eclipse IDE
(<a href="http://www.eclipse.org/"><tt>www.eclipse.org</tt></a>)
that provides a perspective geared towards education and
collaboration in learning new programming languages. This
project generalizes the work done on the FUNNIE project
(<a href="http://funnie.sourceforge.net/"><tt>funnie.sourceforge.net</tt></a>)
during the summer of 2004 for usage with any language. Extension points
are provided by CPPLL so that language plugin developers would only have
to define language specific classes for use with this plugin. This would
allow for a common perspective for language learning without much more
work for developers beyond writing their language tools in Java. For
example interpreters for programming languages already written in Java
can be used without any changes to the existing code. JavaScript and
Jython extensions to CPPLL will be developed along with other language
extensions if time permits. If time permits, a stand-alone version of
CPPLL will be developed using the Eclipse Rich Client Platform.</p>
</dd>

<dt>David Hafley, "The Automated House"</dt>
<dd>
<p>For my senior project, I will be focusing on the automation of
electrical processes in a house.  This idea came to me two summers ago
when I was an intern for an engineering firm in St. Louis.  There,
I assisted the engineers in automation of processes in factories.
My main work was done designing Human Machine Interfaces for placement
on the factory floor.</p>

<p>I plan to be able to control most every electric process in the
house, but have not decided on a final list.  The mostly likely list
will include some if not all of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>Light switches (on/off)</li>
<li>HV/AC temperature control (analog temperature)</li>
<li>Garage door (open/closed)</li>
<li>Alarm system <ul>
    <li>Windows (open/closed)</li>
    <li>Door (open/closed)</li>
</ul></li>
<li>Dishwasher (on/off)</li>
<li>Sprinkler system (on/off)</li>
<li>Every electrical outlet <ul>
    <li>Allowing control of appliances plugged into these outlets</li>
</ul></li>
</ul>

<p>Another feature added would be timed operations.  For example, the user
will be able to set timers for specific lights to be turned on and off
on a regular basis if the user is out of town.  Another feature will
be for the user to control the HV/AC on the same basis, turning the
temperature up in the day when no one is at home and cooling it down
right before everyone returns home after work.  This will save energy
and money for the consumer.</p>
</dd>

<dt>James Hamlin, "Roommate Accounting Made Easy"</dt>
<dd>
<p>I am designing a windows based program for users who live in an
environment with roommates who all contribute to paying the bills.
The ultimate purpose of this program will be to display the amount
each roommate is owed by the other roommate(s) in order for them all
to pay the same amount each month.  Users will log into the program
which will allow them to input the bills that they pay, as well as any
other expenses that they feel should be distributed amongst the group.
Each user will have a unique ID and password so that users are not able
to modify or delete other users. inputs.  By integrating the unistroke
handwriting algorithm into the program, users will be able to enter data
through the keyboard as well as using a pen based method.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Jason Pease, "A Computer Animated Film Short"</dt>
<dd>
<p>Growing up I was always amazed at the production of computer
graphics. Producing a life like image digitally and making it act is
something that I would like to be able to do.  Computer animation is
a big part of the film industry today with movies such as Star Wars,
and The Incredible Hulk, along with complete cgi films such as Monsters
Inc, and Final Fantasy.  For my senior project I would like to create
a computer animated film short. The film would be approximately 5 to
7 minutes in length. In order to create this film I will be using a 3D
animation program which was developed by Carnegie Mellon. Alice 2.0 is
a program that lets me directly manipulate 3-dimensional objects that
I create, and program them to move and act by utilizing python. Alice's
capability to program the object along with camera position and movement
within a 3-dimensional world make it possible to create computer animated
film or video game cut scene.</p>

<p>Alice 2.0 would be the main software that I would use for this project,
however I would also gain valuable knowledge of 3D imaging programs such
as Discreet's 3ds Max, and Right Hemisphere's Deep Paint 3D or other
graphics programs. These programs allow me to create realistic 3D rendered
images with real lighting effects and shading to produce an object or even
a digital actor for my film.  Using all of this software will allow me
to create a 3-dimensional world where all my creations can interact.</p>

<p>Along with all of the 3d rendering software I will be using some of
my own personal digital Video and Sound editing software for the editing
and sound dubbing. The software that I will use will be Sony's Vegas
package and Soundforge's Acid 4.0.  I will use Camtaisa to capture the
video from Alice.</p>

<dt>Kyle Schaefer, "Car integrated media computer"</dt>
<dd>
<p>This project is the design of a user interface to integrate a personal
computer into an automobile.  The main goal of this is to easily allow
the driver access to a large amount of entertainment options that have
previously not been available in a car.  To do this a computer will be
placed in the trunk and wired into the car's factory equipped speakers and
a small touch screen placed in the dash to allow the user more input and
output options.  The computer will draw its power from the car's battery
but be wired into the car's alarm system so that when the alarm is armed
the computer will power down so that the battery will not be depleted.
This computer touchscreen combination would then give the driver access to
a large searchable database of mp3,  mpeg and all other standard computer
media formats, as well as predefined play lists and browsing by album and
artist.  All functions will be easy enough to use that they will not be
more distracting to the driver then operating a standard in car radio.</p>

<h3>Section B (Olowoyeye)</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Audra Butts, "Tee to Green Stats"</dt>
<dd>
<p>Tee to Green Stats will be a database driven high school golf
statistical program that will also aid in conducting competitions
(matches and tournaments). The program will have a database backing in
Microsoft Access with a VBA interface for user-friendly design. The
program will be designed to accommodate the specifics of high school
golf and will track data associated with each players round of
competitive golf throughout an entire season of play. Coaches will be
able to develop a multitude of reports through comparison and
reproduction of data within the database to foster better coaching and
produce competition results. Ultimately this program will be sold to
high school golf coaches for use, but this is not the focus of this
project.</p>

<p>I will start with developing the database in Access. I chose Access
because it is a common database tool that is found on most computer
systems. The Access database will be a collection of tables that will
hold large amounts of data pertaining to approximately 150 golfers. The
front-end will be an interface used by coaches (and occasionally
players) to populate the tables with data they will later use to develop
reports. These capabilities will presented to the user using a variety
of menus developed using VBA.</p>
</dd>

<dt>David James, "PocketFuse"</dt>
<dd>
<p>PocketFuse is an extension of the existing Media Services inventory
management system (Fuse) to allow real-time access to the system from
wireless networking enabled Pocket PC devices such as the Dell Axim
handhelds in use on campus. The existing system tracks equipment
location, status, and assignment information about each item, as well as
a checkout history and maintenance history. In order to access this
information, users must currently have access to a computer equipped
with Microsoft Access and have access to the inventory database file via
the campus Novell Netware system.</p>

<p>PocketFuse allows users to access the inventory information from the
database via PocketPCs, rather than calling into the office and having a
desk worker retrieve the needed information. The PocketFuse system
replicates nearly all of the functionality of the desktop system,
allowing users to view information about existing equipment, edit
details concerning an item (such as changing its location), and add new
items to the inventory. The PocketPCs will access the system through
Pocket Internet Explorer via the campus wireless network.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Anne Mahoney, "&Alpha;&Chi;&Omega; Website"</dt>
<dd>
<p>My senior seminar project consists of a website that I am going to
construct for the DePauw Chapter of my sorority, Alpha Chi Omega. I will
be redesigning the current Alpha Chi Website, which does not have a
database end to it, to be a more effective, user-friendly design
containing the same useful information. There will be two types of user
roles: site members who consist of alumnae and students, and general
users who consist of guests. A general user comes across the website and
has no affiliation with the sorority; however, he or she can learn about
the sorority. I am going to create a clear, user-friendly web page
layout and combine it with a useful database of alumnae from the DePauw
chapter. After logging in, members can view announcements, add comments,
view and edit their personal profiles, learn more about the sorority and
events, see photos, make donations to the Alpha Chi Omega Foundation,
and search for alumnae and view each alumna's profile. The alumnae will
consist of the current senior Alpha Chi Omega class graduating in 2005.
I will be using HTML, SQL Queries and Cold Fusion software with the
programs Macromedia Dreamweaver MX 2004 for the website design and
Microsoft Access for the database set-up plus a Microsoft 2000 Server
for a web server. The Access database will consist of tables to hold the
sorority members, which include information about students and
alumnae.</p>

<dt>Nate Nichols, "BEARHuGS"</dt>
<dd>
<p>Rape is a major problem facing all societies, both modern and
pre-modern; although progress is certainly being made, disturbing
statistics&mdash;in 2002, for example, there were approximately 250,000
victims of rape, attempted rape or sexual assault in America alone (<a
href="www.rainn.com"><tt>www.rainn.com</tt></a>)&mdash;make it clear
that our efforts up to this point have not been sufficient. Noting this,
a number of evolutionary psychologists (especially Randy Thornhill and
Craig T. Palmer) have proposed a radical new idea concerning the
ultimate cause of rape. Referencing a number of statistics concerning
rape, these two scientists reject the typical social scientist
explanation&mdash;that rape mainly results from a misogynistic culture
that preaches violence and domination&mdash;and instead insist that we
should look into our own evolutionary past to root out the motivations
for rape and then draw future policy changes from this increased
knowledge.</p>

<p>Not surprisingly, their claims&mdash;that rape is often an unfortunate
outcome of several male genetic motivating factors, or that there is
actually a male "rape gene"&mdash;are hotly debated in scientific circles;
while many arguments are simply knee-jerk morality claims, some
scientists have doubts about whether such violently anti-social behavior
could actually evolve. They cite statistics concerning the extremely low
pregnancy rate stemming from rapes, as well as the violence frequently
perpetrated against caught rapists as evidence that rape doesn't really
increase the rapists' reproductive potential.</p>

<p>My hope is that BEARHuGS will be able to help inform these debates by
simulating early humans and studying their rape patterns. I intend
BEARHuGS to be a scientific tool; therefore, I will be spending the
majority of my time in programming the simulation and not on an
appealing interface or assistive help files. The core of the agent-based
simulation is a population of creatures (HuGs) each driven by their
personal neural net, which is composed of a number of "action modules".
They have a number of possible actions (sleep, hunt, chat, etc.), each
represented by an action module, and they choose between the actions
based on the output of these modules. If a female happens to conceive,
the child's genes will be a combination of its parents' genetic code.
Each creature will have an opportunity in turn to take an action; once
the entire population has acted, one cycle of the simulation will be
complete and the next will begin. As new babies are born and older
creatures die, the species will evolve with each cycle. After the
simulation has been completed to the user's satisfaction, BEARHuGS will
output an HTML report with statistics and the story of each individual
creature. By modifying various parameters of the simulation and studying
the final reports, users will be able to study under what circumstances
rape occurs and is selected for, and hopefully, new ideas for ending
this awful crime.</p>

<dt>Ben Steffen, "Skeleton 3D Model"</dt>
<dd>
<p>This project will be to create a 3D model editing program which can
be used to create a "skeleton" for the model that is used for animation,
similar to "bones animation" used in many commercial 3D modeling and
animation programs. In bones animation, vertices of the model are
assigned to units of the skeleton and move along with those units during
animation. The project will differ from standard bones animation,
however, in that the units making up the skeleton will be assigned
physical properties, such as mass and volume, which will allow the model
to be animated in a physics-based animator. Therefore, as the second
component to the project, there will also be a keyframe animator which
can generate physics-based animations from the physical attributes of a
model's skeleton. The potential application of this project would be to
increase the realism and interactivity of animations in computer games
and other real-time interactive simulations.</p>

<h3>Section C (Bell)</h3>
<dl>
<dt>Robert Bruder, "Electronic Forms Design: Real Estate Forms"</dt>
<dd>
<p>In his project Rob will take common paper forms used in a real
estate broker's office and convert them to an easy to use electronic
forms application. The main focus of Rob's project will be a graphical
user interface which will be designed with the forms designer included
with MS Access.net. An MS Access.Net database will be used to support
the data storage capacity. Currently all real estate forms are filled
out by hand. It is Rob's goal to make a more efficient easy to use
program that will allow the realtor to complete the forms electronically
and print them on a printer. </p>
</dd>

<dt>David Egger, "digiState"</dt>
<dd>
<p>A web based piece of software, utilizing PHP and MySQL, as well as
Javascript and XML. Users will be able to create multiple business
entities, as well as multiple real estate entities in the database. Each
real estate entity will contain full information about the property, as
well as keep track of mortgage payments, expenses both deductible and
not, income, tenants and tenant incidents. Storage of lease agreements
for later reference will be included. The site will also be able to let
tenants log in and make rental payments via PayPal. Property Managers
will be able to enter rental dates, triggering emails to property owners
(short term rental properties like condos).</p>
</dd>

<dt>Anthony Jacob, "The Science of Checkers"</dt>
<dd>
<p>My project "The Science of Checkers" will take a closer in depth look
into the scientific aspect to the game of checkers, also known as
English Draughts. I will create a program that will allow a human to
play checkers against the computer following the standard rules of the
game. I will focus mainly on the Artificial Intelligence part of the
program by creating a database that keeps track of the consequences of
the decisions made by the computer. The computer will always evaluate
its available options based on the success of its former moves. This
will make the computer's moves gradually better through reinforcement
learning. I will then incorporate a graphical interface into the program
after the implementation and construction of the actual game play and
reinforcement learning is complete.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Seth Kinnett, "Writer-Launcher"</dt>
<dd>
<p>Students who use pen-based computers often find the pen to be
effective for some operations in Windows, but not for others. Frequently
switching from mouse to pen to keyboard takes up valuable time that
could be spent elsewhere. The purpose of Writer-Launcher is to provide a
medium through which users can quickly launch programs of their choosing
by using a single pen stroke. For the apt user, such a program will
eliminate the need to move back and forth to the mouse and may speed up
time spent launching programs. Users of the program would store their
preferred gestures and associate them with any installed program they
wish to run. For example, if users wanted to launch Visual C++.NET, they
might decide they prefer to draw a 'C.' They could draw the C and
associate it to launch C++. Then, anytime they later drew a 'C,' Visual
C++.NET would be executed.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Atanas Vlahov, "Solving Assignment Problems and Simulating the
Behavior of Intelligent Agents"</dt>
<dd>
<p>The first goal of my project is to examine two approaches for making
a decision. The decision to be made is how to assign a number of workers
to the same number of jobs so that the jobs are completed in the least
amount of time. The first way to solve the problem is to represent it as
an optimization problem and use methods from the field of operations
research. This type of problem is a balanced transportation problem in
which all supplies and demands are equal to 1 and is also called an
assignment problem. The second way to approach the problem is to use a
genetic algorithm to arrive at a solution. Each member of the population
of the genetic algorithm will be a possible assignment of which worker
should do which job. For instance, if there are three jobs to be done
then the individual <code>| 3 | 1 | 2 |</code> represents assigning
worker 1 to complete job 3, worker 2 to complete job 1, and worker 3 to
complete job 2.</p>

<p>The second goal of my project is to simulate how a colony of ants
finds and gathers food. I will develop several different ant behaviors
and test them against each other. The test will consist of putting two
colonies of ants with different behaviors on a map with limited
resources. The winner will be the colony that manages to bring the most
food items back to its anthill in a certain amount of time.</p>
</dd>

<dt>Adam Webb, "Gedric-Enhanced Application Software (GEAS)"</dt>
<dd>
<p>My senior project, named GEAS (Gedric-Enhanced Application Software),
will be a gedric-driven software launching application which will allow
the user to launch the program of his or her choice by making the
corresponding gesture within the designated drawing area in the
lower-right corner of the screen. GEAS users will be able to create and
save their own gestures and assign them to launch additional
applications beyond the default set of gestures provided by GEAS. Beyond
launching applications, GEAS will enable users to assign gestures to
gain access to their favorite websites in one easy step. This project
will focus on presenting the user with an intuitive, easy navigable
interface which I will refine based on feedback gained from several
usability tests of both beta and final versions of this application.
Also, the design of GEAS's interface should allow students who are
pressed for time to have quick and easy access to core programs such as
Microsoft Internet Explorer, Microsoft Office programs such as Microsoft
Word, Excel, Powerpoint and email applications such as Novell GroupWise.
Ideally, I wish to enable my fellow students to stay up-to-date on email
while reducing the amount of "hunting" through menus to find their
desired application to open and print assignments with the minimum
amount of user stress.</p>
