<P>
This handout continues with a summary of the commands you will use
when compiling C++ programs on a Linux system.  For further
information on each of these, consult the corresponding <code>man</code>
page (for example, do <code>man g++</code>).  Many of the utilities come
from the GNU project, which doesn't like to maintain <code>man</code> pages,
so frequently there will be more information in the <code>info</code> system
(do <code>info g++</code>, for example).</P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00010000000000000000">
Compiling and Linking</A>
</H1>
<P>
The C++ compiler is <code>g++</code>.  If you just have a single source
file, for example <code>myprog.cc</code>, then you may compile and link it
in one step with the command</P>
<PRE>
g++ myprog.cc -o myprog
</PRE>
<P>If there are no errors, this will produce an executable named
<code>myprog</code> in the current directory.  To run it, type</P>
<PRE>
./myprog
</PRE>
<P>(the <code>./</code> prefix tells the command shell where to find the
program, since by default it may not look in the current
directory for programs).</P>

<P>
If your program consists of several source files, you will need to
compile each of them into an <SPAN  CLASS="textit">object</SPAN> file and then link them
together into an executable.  For example, suppose that
<code>myprog2.cc</code> uses a class that is implemented in <code>myclass.cc</code>
(there should also be an interface in <code>myclass.h</code>, but the
<code>#include</code> line in <code>myprog.cc</code> handles that; by the way,
most facilities from the Standard Library will be automatically linked
with your program, so the <code>#include</code> is all that you need to use
them).  You will use <code>g++</code>, with the <code>-c</code> (for ``compile'')
option, once on each source file to produce the object files, which
have a <code>.o</code> extension:</P>
<PRE>
g++ -c myprog2.cc
g++ -c myclass.cc
</PRE>
<P>Then the object files need to be linked together with the command</P>
<PRE>
g++ myprog2.o myclass.o -o myprog2
</PRE>
<P>This process is considerably simplified by writing a make file (see
below).</P>

<P>
There are many options you may supply to <code>g++</code>; see the
documentation for a list (with full descriptions in the <code>info</code>
viewer).  Some of the most common are <code>-Wall</code>, which tells the
compiler to print all of the warnings of possibly incorrect code that
it finds, <code>-g</code>, which causes the compiler to insert debugging
information in the compiled code (for use with <code>gdb</code>), and
<code>-O</code>, which turns on some of the code optimizations (unlike some
compilers, <code>g++</code> allows <code>-O</code> to be used with <code>-g</code>,
although optimized code might do some unexpected things while
debugging).  For example, the file <code>myprog.cc</code> could be compiled
with warnings and debugging information by executing</P>
<PRE>
g++ -Wall -g myprog.cc -o myprog
</PRE>

Project Management</A>
</H1>
<P>As noted above, compiling all of the files that comprise a large
project can involve lots of repetitive typing of commands.  In
addition, after editing some of the source files, you should only
recompile those that have changed.  This is not as trivial as it may
seem, since editing a header file will require recompiling all of the
implementation files that include it, directly or indirectly.  The
solution to all of these problems is to create a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">make file</SPAN>,
which is a compact description of all of the pieces of a multi-file
project.  The <code>make</code> command takes this file and executes all of
the required steps to bring the project up to date.</P>

<P>
Here is a simple make file, which should be stored in the project
directory under the name <code>Makefile</code>:</P>
<PRE>
# Make file for myprog2
myprog2 : myprog2.o myclass.o
	g++ myprog2.o myclass.o -o myprog2

myprog2.o : myprog2.cc myclass.h
	g++ -c myprog2.cc

myclass.o : myclass.cc myclass.h
	g++ -c myclass.cc
</PRE>

<P>
The first line is a comment; <code>make</code> ignores any line that starts
with <code>#</code>.  The next two lines describe how to make the full
program (<code>make</code> will use the first such entry in the make file as
the default <SPAN  CLASS="textit">target</SPAN> to be made, so it is a good idea to put the
entry to link your program first).  The line with the colon describes
the conditions under which the rule will be applied.  It says that the
file <code>myprog2</code> depends on the files <code>myprog2.o</code> and
<code>myclass.o</code>; if <code>myprog2</code> doesn't exist, or is older than
either of the <code>.o</code> files, then the body of the rule will be used
to produce an up-to-date version of <code>myprog2</code>.  The body of the
rule, the line with <code>g++</code>, gives the command to execute.
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">It is important to note that this line starts with a TAB
character; it will not work if the line starts with spaces.</SPAN></P>

<P>
The following entries describe how to produce the <code>.o</code> files, if
they don't exist or are out-of-date.  As before, the line with the
colon describes the dependencies of each file:  <code>myprog2.o</code>
depends on both <code>myprog2.cc</code> and <code>myclass.h</code>, so it will
need to be recompiled if either of those files has been changed.  In
general, the list of dependencies for an object file will be the
corresponding source file plus all of the (non-standard) header files
that it includes.  There is a tool called <code>makedepend</code> which will
automate the process of generating these dependency lists; see
<code>man makedepend</code>.</P>

<P>
Instead of creating a make file such as the above from scratch for
each project, it is a good idea to start with a make file template and
customize it.  Here is a simple example:</P>
<PRE>
# Makefile template
#
# Fill in the definitions of the variables:
# SRCS = a list of your .cc files
# HDRS = a list of your .h files
# PROG = the name of the executable you are making
#
# Then execute "make depend" followed by "make"
#
# Use "make print" to send nicely formatted listings to the Linux lab printer
# Use "make clean" to remove the executable and other files generated by make

SRCS = myprog2.cc myclass.cc
HDRS = myclass.h
PROG = myprog

# You should not need to change anything below this line.

OBJS = $(SRCS:.cc=.o)

CXX = g++
CXXFLAGS = -Wall -g -I/home/libs/dataStr/ftsoftds/include
LIBS = -L/home/libs/dataStr/ftsoftds/lib -lezdraw -L/usr/X11R6/lib -lXaw -lXmu -lXt -lX11

DEPFILE = .depends
PRINTER = JSC276

all : $(PROG)

$(PROG) : $(OBJS)
	$(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) $(OBJS) -o $(PROG) $(LIBS)

depend :
	$(CXX) $(CXXFLAGS) -MM $(SRCS) > $(DEPFILE)

print :
	a2ps -A virtual $(HDRS) $(SRCS) | lpr -P $(PRINTER)

clean :
	rm -f $(PROG) $(OBJS) $(DEPFILE) core

sinclude $(DEPFILE)
</PRE>
<P>When you execute <code>make depend</code>, it will compute a series of rules (stored in
the hidden file <code>.depends</code>) which will be included in
the make file which cover building the object files from the
sources, taking into account any header file dependencies.  I also
included targets <code>print</code> and <code>clean</code> in this example; doing
<code>make print</code> will send a nicely formatted listing of your source
programs to the laser printer in 276, while <code>make clean</code> will
remove all of the files that may have been generated in previous
compiles, so that you can do a clean compile of all of the parts of
the program (or so you can reduce disk usage when you no longer need
to run the program).</P>
