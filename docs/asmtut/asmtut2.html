<H3>Registers</H3>

In 16-bit mode, such as provided by the Pentium processor when operating as a
Virtual 8086 (this is the mode used when Windows 95 displays a DOS prompt),
the processor provides the programmer with 14 internal registers, each 16 bits
wide.  They are grouped into several categories as follows:
<UL>

<LI> Four general-purpose registers, AX, BX, CX, and DX.  Each of these is a
combination of two 8-bit registers which are separately accessible as AL, BL,
CL, DL (the "low'' bytes) and AH, BH, CH, and DH (the "high'' bytes).  For
example, if AX contains the 16-bit number <TT>1234h</TT>, then AL contains
<TT>34h</TT> and AH contains <TT>12h</TT>.
<LI> Four special-purpose registers, SP, BP, SI, and DI.
<LI> Four segment registers, CS, DS, ES, and SS.
<LI> The instruction pointer, IP (sometimes referred to as the program
counter).
<LI> The status flag register, FLAGS.
</UL>
<P>
Although I refer to the first four registers as "general-purpose'', each of
them is designed to play a particular role in common use:
<UL>

<LI> AX is the "accumulator''; some of the operations, such as
<TT>MUL</TT> and <TT>DIV</TT>, require that one of the operands be in the
accumulator. Some other operations, such as <TT>ADD</TT> and <TT>SUB</TT>, may be
applied to any of the registers (that is, any of the eight general- and
special-purpose registers) but are more efficient when working with the
accumulator.
<LI> BX is the "base'' register; it is the only general-purpose register
which may be used for indirect addressing.  For example, the instruction
<TT>MOV [BX], AX</TT> causes the contents of AX to be stored in the memory
location whose address is given in BX.
<LI> CX is the "count'' register. The looping instructions
(<TT>LOOP</TT>, <TT>LOOPE</TT>, and <TT>LOOPNE</TT>), the shift and rotate
instructions (<TT>RCL</TT>, <TT>RCR</TT>, <TT>ROL</TT>, <TT>ROR</TT>,
<TT>SHL</TT>, <TT>SHR</TT>, and <TT>SAR</TT>), and the string instructions
(with the prefixes <TT>REP</TT>, <TT>REPE</TT>, and <TT>REPNE</TT>) all use
the count register to determine how many times they will repeat.
<LI> DX is the "data'' register; it is used together with AX for the
word-size <TT>MUL</TT> and <TT>DIV</TT> operations, and it can also hold the port
number for the <TT>IN</TT> and <TT>OUT</TT> instructions, but it is mostly
available as a convenient place to store data, as are all of the other
general-purpose registers.
</UL>
<P>
Here are brief descriptions of the four special-purpose registers:
<UL>

<LI> SP is the stack pointer, indicating the current position of the top of
the stack.  You should generally never modify this directly, since the
subroutine and interrupt call-and-return mechanisms depend on the contents of
the stack.
<LI> BP is the base pointer, which can be used for indirect addressing
similar to BX.
<LI> SI is the source index, used as a pointer to the current character being
read in a string instruction (<TT>LODS</TT>, <TT>MOVS</TT>, or <TT>CMPS</TT>).  It
is also available as an offset to add to BX or BP when doing indirect
addressing; for example, the instruction <TT>MOV [BX+SI], AX</TT> copies the
contents of AX into the memory location whose address is the sum of the
contents of BX and SI.
<LI> DI is the destination index, used as a pointer to the current character
being written or compared in a string instruction (<TT>MOVS</TT>, <TT>STOS</TT>,
<TT>CMPS</TT>, or <TT>SCAS</TT>).  It is also available as an offset, just like
SI.
</UL>
<P>
Since all of these registers are 16 bits wide, they can only contain
addresses for memory within a range of 64K (=2^16) bytes.  To
support machines with more than 64K of physical memory, Intel
implemented the concept of <EM>segmented</EM> memory.  At any given time,
a 16-bit address will be interpreted as an offset within a 64K segment
determined by one of the four segment registers (CS, DS, ES, and SS).<P>
As an example, in the instruction <TT>MOV [BX], AX</TT> mentioned above, the
BX register really provides the offset of a location in the current data
segment; to find the true physical address into which the contents of
the accumulator will be stored, you have to add the value in BX to the
address of the start of the data segment.  This segment start address is
determined by taking the 16-bit number in DS and multiplying by 16.
Therefore, if DS contains <TT>1234h</TT> and BX contains <TT>0017h</TT>, then
the physical address will be
<TT>1234h</TT> TIMES 16+<TT>0017h</TT>=<TT>12340h</TT>+<TT>0017h</TT>=<TT>12357h</TT>.
(This computation illustrates one reason why hexadecimal is so useful;
multiplication by 16 corresponds to shifting the hex digits left one
place and appending a zero.)  We refer to this combined address as
<TT>1234:0017</TT> or, more generally, as <TT>DS:BX</TT>.<P>
Since segment starts are computed by multiplying a 16-bit number by
16=2^4, the effect is that physical addresses have a 20-bit range, so
that a total of 1M (=2^20) of memory may be used. Intel considered
that this would be enough for applications of the 8086 over its
projected lifetime of about five years from its introduction in 1978; by
the time microcomputers were needing more than a meg of main memory, the
next Intel processor (the iAPX432) was due to be available, with a
32-bit address space (able to address 4G---over 4 billion memory
locations). However, the IBM PC's debut in 1981 and subsequent
popularity has forced Intel to continue the 80x86 family of
backward-compatible processors to the present, including support for a
mode in which only 1M of memory is accessible.  Processors since the
80286 have also provided the "protected'' mode of operation, which in
the Pentium gives each process a flat 32-bit address space of up to 4G.<P>
You might think that a segment register would only need to provide the
uppermost 4 bits to extend an address out to 20 bits, but consider one
of the implications of only having 16 different, non-overlapping
segments: every segment would have to occupy a full 64K of memory, even
if only a small fraction of this space were needed. By allowing a
segment to start at any address divisible by 16, the memory may be
allocated much more efficiently---if one program only needs 4K for its
code segment, then theoretically the operating system could load another
program into a segment starting just 4K above the start of the first. Of
course, MS-DOS is not really this sophisticated, but the Intel designers
wanted it to be possible.<P>
Each segment register has its own special uses:
<UL>

<LI> CS determines the "code'' segment; this is where the executable
code of a program is located.  It is not directly modifiable by the
programmer, except by executing one of the branching instructions.  One
of the reasons for separating the code segment from other segments is
that well-behaved programs never modify their code while executing;
therefore, the code segment can be identified as "read-only''.  This
simplifies the work of a cache, since no effort is required to maintain
consistency between the cache and main memory.  It also permits several
instances of a single program to run at once (in a multitasking
operating system), all sharing the same code segment in memory; each
instance has its own data and stack segments where the information
specific to the instance is kept.  Picture multiple windows, each running
Word on a different document; each one needs its own data segment to
store its document, but they can all execute the same loaded copy of Word.<P>
<LI> DS determines the "data'' segment; it is the default segment for
most memory accesses.<P>
<LI> ES determines the "extra'' segment; it can be used instead of DS
when data from two segments need to be accessed at once.  In particular,
the DI register gives an offset relative to ES when used in the string
instructions; for example, the <TT>MOVSB</TT> instruction copies a byte
from <TT>DS:SI</TT> to <TT>ES:DI</TT> (and also causes SI and DI to be
incremented or decremented, ready to copy the next byte).<P>
<LI> SS determines the "stack'' segment; the stack pointer SP gives
the offset of the current top-of-stack within the stack segment.  The BP
register also gives an offset relative to the stack segment by default,
for convenient access to data further down in the stack without having
to modify SP.  Just as with SP, you should not modify SS unless you know
exactly what you are doing.
</UL>
<P>
The instruction pointer, IP, gives the address of the <EM>next</EM>
instruction to be executed, relative to the code segment.  The only way
to modify this is with a branch instruction.<P>
The status register, FLAGS, is a collection of 1-bit values which
reflect the current state of the processor and the results of recent
operations.  Nine of the sixteen bits are used in the 8086:
<UL>

<LI> Carry (bit 0): set if the last arithmetic operation ended with a
leftover carry bit coming off the left end of the result.  This signals
an overflow on unsigned numbers.
<LI> Parity (bit 2): set if the low-order byte of the last data
operation contained an even number of 1 bits (that is, it signals an
even parity condition).
<LI> Auxiliary Carry (bit 4): used when working with binary coded
decimal (BCD) numbers.
<LI> Zero (bit 6): set if the last computation had a zero result.
After a comparison (<TT>CMP</TT>, <TT>CMPS</TT>, or <TT>SCAS</TT>), this
indicates that the values compared were equal (since their difference
was zero).
<LI> Sign (bit 7): set if the last computation had a negative result (a
1 in the leftmost bit).
<LI> Trace (bit 8): when set, this puts the CPU into single-step mode,
as used by debuggers.
<LI> Interrupt (bit 9): when set, interrupts are enabled.  This bit
should be cleared while the processor is executing a critical section of
code that should not be interrupted (for example, when processing
another interrupt).
<LI> Direction (bit 10): when clear, the string operations move from
low addresses to high (the SI and DI registers are incremented after
each character).  When set, the direction is reversed (SI and DI are
decremented).
<LI> Overflow (bit 11): set if the last arithmetic operation caused a
signed overflow (for example, after adding <TT>0001h</TT> to <TT>7FFFh</TT>,
resulting in <TT>8000h</TT>; read as two's complement numbers, this
corresponds to adding 1 to 32767 and ending up with -32768).
</UL>

There are numerous operations that will test and manipulate various of
these flags, but to get the contents of the entire FLAGS register one
has to push the flags onto the stack (with <TT>PUSHF</TT> or by calling an
appropriate interrupt handler with <TT>INT</TT>) and then pop them off
into another register. To set the entire FLAGS register, the sequence is
reversed (with <TT>POPF</TT> or <TT>IRET</TT>). For example, one way to set
the carry flag (there are much better ways, including the <TT>STC</TT>
instruction) is the following:
<PRE>
        PUSHF
        POP     AX
        OR      AX, 1
        PUSH    AX
        POPF
</PRE>
Most of the time you will not have to deal with the FLAGS register
explicitly; instead, you will execute one of the conditional branch
instructions, <TT>Jcc</TT>, where <TT>cc</TT> is one of the following
mnemonic condition codes:
<UL>

<LI> <TT>O</TT>, Overflow
<LI> <TT>NO</TT>, Not Overflow
<LI> <TT>B</TT>, Below; <TT>C</TT>, Carry; <TT>NAE</TT>, Not Above or Equal
<LI> <TT>NB</TT>, Not Below; <TT>NC</TT>, Not Carry; <TT>AE</TT>, Above or
Equal
<LI> <TT>E</TT>, Equal; <TT>Z</TT>, Zero
<LI> <TT>NE</TT>, Not Equal; <TT>NZ</TT>, Not Zero
<LI> <TT>BE</TT>, Below or Equal; <TT>NA</TT>, Not Above (true if either Carry or
Zero is set)
<LI> <TT>NBE</TT>, Not Below or Equal; <TT>A</TT>, Above
<LI> <TT>S</TT>, Sign
<LI> <TT>NS</TT>, Not Sign
<LI> <TT>P</TT>, Parity; <TT>PE</TT>, Parity Even
<LI> <TT>NP</TT>, Not Parity; <TT>PO</TT>, Parity Odd
<LI> <TT>L</TT>, Less; <TT>NGE</TT>, Not Greater or Equal (true if Sign and
Overflow are different)
<LI> <TT>NL</TT>, Not Less; <TT>GE</TT>, Greater or Equal
<LI> <TT>LE</TT>, Less or Equal; <TT>NG</TT>, Not Greater (true if Sign and
Overflow are different, or Zero is set)
<LI> <TT>NLE</TT>, Not Less or Equal; <TT>G</TT>, Greater
</UL>

All of the conditions on the same line are synonyms.  The Above and
Below conditions refer to comparisons of unsigned numbers, and the Less
and Greater conditions refer to comparisons of signed (two's complement)
numbers.<P>
