<H3>Data Movement Instructions</H3>

The fundamental data movement operation is <TT>MOV dest, source</TT>,
which copies a byte or a word from the source location to the
destination.  In general, either the source or the destination must be a
register (you can't copy directly from one memory location to another
with <TT>MOV</TT>); the only exception is that an immediate value may be
moved straight to memory (however, there is no way to put an immediate
value into a segment register in one operation).  Here are the accepted
forms:
<PRE>
        MOV     reg8, r/m/i8
        MOV     mem8, reg8
        MOV     mem8, BYTE imm8

        MOV     reg16, r/m/i16
        MOV     mem16, reg16
        MOV     mem16, WORD imm16

        MOV     r/m16, segreg
        MOV     segreg, r/m16
</PRE>
The CS segment register may not be used as a destination (you wouldn't
want to do this anyway, since it would change where the next instruction
comes from; to get this effect, you need to use a proper flow control
instruction such as <TT>JMP</TT>).<P>
To perform a swap of two locations instead of a one-way copy, there is
also an exchange operation:
<PRE>
        XCHG    reg8, r/m8
        XCHG    reg16, r/m16
</PRE>
As a special case of this that does nothing except occupy space and take
up processor time, the instruction to exchange the accumulator with
itself (<TT>XCHG AX, AX</TT>) is given the special "no-operation''
mnemonic:
<PRE>
        NOP
</PRE>
For the special purpose of copying a far pointer (that is, a pointer
that includes a segment address, so that it can refer to a location
outside the current segment) from memory into registers, there are the
<TT>LDS</TT> and <TT>LES</TT> instructions.  Here are the accepted forms:
<PRE>
        LDS     reg16, mem32
        LES     reg16, mem32
</PRE>
For example, the instruction <TT>LDS SI, [200h]</TT> is equivalent to the
pair of instructions <TT>MOV SI, [200h]</TT> and <TT>MOV DS, [202h]</TT>.
The 8086 only supports loading the pointer into the DS or ES segment
register.<P>
An operation that is frequently useful when setting up pointers is to
load the "effective address'' of a memory reference.  That is, this
instruction does the displacement plus base plus index calculation, but
just stores the resulting address in the destination register, rather
than actually fetching the data from the address.  Here is the only form
allowed on the 8086:
<PRE>
        LEA     reg16, mem
</PRE>
To push and pop data from the stack, the 8086 provides the following
instructions.  The top of stack is located at offset SP within the stack
segment, so <TT>PUSH AX</TT>, for example, is equivalent to
<TT>SUB SP, 2</TT> (recall that the stack grows downward) followed by
<TT>MOV [SS:SP], AX</TT> (except that <TT>[SS:SP]</TT> isn't a valid form of
memory reference).
<PRE>
        PUSH    r/m16
        PUSH    segreg

        POP     r/m16
        POP     segreg
</PRE>
As with <TT>MOV</TT>, you are not allowed to <TT>POP</TT> into the CS
register (although you may <TT>PUSH CS</TT>).<P>
Although they were not provided on the original 8086, the instructions
to push and pop the FLAGS register (as mentioned earlier) are available
in Virtual-8086 mode on the Pentium (they were actually introduced in
the 80186):
<PRE>
        PUSHF
        POPF
</PRE>
Here are the other ways of reading or modifying the FLAGS register
(apart from setting flags as the result of an arithmetic operation, or
testing them with a conditional branch, of course).  The Carry,
Direction, and Interrupt Enable flags may be cleared and set:
<PRE>
        CLC
        CLD
        CLI
        STC
        STD
        STI
</PRE>
The Carry flag may also be complemented, or "toggled'' between 0 and 1:
<PRE>
        CMC
</PRE>
Finally, the bottom eight bits of the FLAGS register (containing the
Carry, Parity, Auxiliary Carry, Zero, and Sign flags, as described
above) may be transferred to and from the AH register:
<PRE>
        LAHF
        SAHF
</PRE>
