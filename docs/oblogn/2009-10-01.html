    <p>It's a Small World, Kindergarten Division</p>
    <p>Continuing the theme of stories of odd coincidences from my life, here's a short one in which I played an
        important, though passive, role.</p>

    <p>My Kindergarten teacher in Cleveland Heights was Mrs. Sugimoto. I suppose she had a first name, but it didn't
        really occur to me as a five-year-old to ask such a thing, certainly not of Mrs. Sugimoto. She was Japanese, and
        during the summer a year or two after I was in her class she traveled back to Japan for a visit. On the way, she
        spent a few days in Honolulu.</p>

    <p>My aunt and her family were living in Hawaii at that time, and it happened that her mother, my grandmother, was
        out there for a visit (although her home was in Cleveland). One day she went to a restaurant at one of the
        hotels on Waikiki Beach (we could pretend that it was the Royal Hawaiian, but it doesn't really matter). It was
        busy, so she agreed to share a table with another single woman. They got to chatting, and were surprised to find
        out that they were both from Cleveland. Furthermore, they were both teachers. When my grandmother heard that the
        other woman (who was, of course, Mrs. Sugimoto) taught Kindergarten in Cleveland Heights, she asked whether she
        knew me, and was astounded to learn that she had just sat down with her grandson's teacher, 4500 miles from
        home!</p>
