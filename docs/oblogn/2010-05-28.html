        <p>Butler Butler Butler, the Time Paradox Butler</p>
        <p>Butler Butler Butler was employed by the Professor, who had just invented
            a time machine. The butler borrowed the time machine to go back and cause
            his given name to be Butler; further back, he managed to change his family
            name to Butler as well. He did this because, paradoxically, the only reason
            the Professor gave him the job was because he was named Butler Butler, which
            seemed appropriate. This was just the start of the time paradoxes caused by
            B.B.B., who was only surpassed in annoying behavior by Willie DeVille, Evil Valet.
