<p>PCF, as considered in this paper, is a lazy typed lambda calculus
with functions, pairing, fixed-point operators and arbitrary algebraic
data types.  The natural equational axioms for PCF include
eta-equivalence and the so-called  "surjective pairing" axiom for
pairs.  However, the reduction system <i>pcfesp</i> defined by directing
each equational axiom is not confluent, for virtually any choice of
algebraic data types.  Moreover, neither eta-reduction nor surjective
pairing seems to have a counterpart in ordinary execution.  Therefore,
we consider a smaller reduction system <i>pcf</i> without eta-reduction
or surjective pairing.  The system <i>pcf</i>  is confluent when
combined with any linear, confluent algebraic rewrite rules.  The
system is also computationally adequate, in the sense that whenever a
closed term of "observable" type has a <i>pcfesp</i> normal form, this
is also the unique <i>pcf</i> normal form.  Moreover, the equational
axioms for PCF, including (eta) and surjective pairing, are sound for
<i>pcf</i> observational equivalence.  These results suggest that if we
take the equational axioms as defining the language, the smaller
reduction system gives an appropriate operational semantics.</p>

<p>We consider the interaction of recursion with extensional data types
in several typed functional programming languages based on the
simply-typed lambda calculus.  Our main results concern the relation
between the equational proof systems for reasoning about terms and the
operational semantics for evaluating programs.  We also present several
results about the expressivity of the languages, compared according to
both the functions and the data types definable in them.  The methods
used are those of classical lambda calculus and category theory.</p>
<p>The first language discussed is a variant of Scott and Plotkin's
PCF, which adds to the simply-typed lambda calculus products, fixed
points of functions, and algebraic data types specified by a signature
and a set of equations.  PCF is able to express all partial computable
functions over the given basic types, but the corresponding reduction
system is not confluent if we include the usual surjective pairing
rule, which expresses the extensionality of products.  Extensionality
is necessary in the proof system for establishing many useful
isomorphisms between types, but it does not seem to have an intuitive
"computational content."  We show that a smaller reduction system
without extensional rules is sufficient for computing the result of
program execution, and that this smaller system is confluent whenever
the algebraic rules are confluent and left-linear.  If the algebraic
rules are also terminating and left-normal then a leftmost reduction
strategy is complete for finding normal forms.</p>
<p>We then consider a pair of languages, lambda-mu-nu and
lambda-bottom-rho, which support the definition of structured data
types through categorical means rather than via multi-sorted algebras.
The first language, lambda-mu-nu, extends the types of the simply-typed
lambda calculus with extensional products and sums, and least and
greatest fixed points of positive recursive type expressions.  By
dropping the extensional rules as for PCF, we obtain a confluent and
strongly normalizing reduction system, adequate for obtaining results
of programs.  It is easy to represent many common data types in this
language, such as booleans, natural numbers, lists, trees, and
(computable) streams, as well as many of the total functions over such
structures.  Indeed, we may define more functions over the natural
numbers than are provably total in Peano arithmetic, hence the language
is more expressive than G&ouml;del's system <b>T</b>.  It is no more
expressive than the Girard/Reynolds system <b>F</b> in terms of
definable functions; however, we are able to define <em>algorithms</em>
that are not expressible in <b>F</b>, such as a constant-time
predecessor function on the naturals.</p>
<p>The final language, lambda-bottom-rho, extends lambda-mu-nu by
introducing lifted types, which contain a bottom element, signifying
that evaluation of a term of such a type may not terminate.  Lifted
types allow us to find fixed points of mixed-variant recursive type
expressions; for example, the solution of <i>X = X -&gt; X_bottom</i>
gives a type for expressions of an eager untyped lambda calculus, while
the solution of <i>X = (X -&gt; X)_bottom</i> is suitable as a type for
expressions of a lazy untyped calculus.  We again have a confluent
operational semantics for the language, although of course it is not
strongly normalizing.  However, we show that a lazy reduction strategy
will find normal forms for terms which have them.  We also examine the
relations among the three kinds of recursive type in lambda-bottom-rho,
which we refer to as <em>inductive</em> (least), <em>projective</em>
(greatest), and <em>retractive</em> (mixed-variant); in the natural cpo
model of the language, we give conditions under which the different
constructions will coincide.</p>

<p>We give an analysis of classes of recursive types by presenting two
extensions of the simply-typed lambda calculus.  The first language only
allows recursive types with built-in principles of well-founded
induction, while the second allows more general recursive types which
permit non-terminating computations.  We discuss the expressive power of
the languages, examine the properties of reduction-based operational
semantics for them, and give examples of their use in expressing
iteration over large ordinals and in simulating both call-by-name and
call-by-value versions of the untyped lambda calculus.  The motivations
for this work come from category theoretic models.</p>

<p>In "A Synthesis of Several Sorting Algorithms", Darlington showed
how to use program transformation techniques to develop versions of six
well-known sorting algorithms. The purpose of this note is to provide
more evidence for the naturalness of the resulting taxonomy of
algorithms by showing how it follows almost immediately from a
consideration of the types of the objects involved. By exploiting the
natural operations of iteration and coiteration over recursively
defined data types, we may automatically derive the structure of each
algorithm.</p>

<p>An extension of the simply-typed lambda calculus is presented which
contains both well-structured inductive and coinductive types, and
which also identifies a class of types for which general recursion is
possible.  The motivations for this work are certain natural
constructions in category theory, in particular the notion of an
algebraically bounded functor, due to Freyd.  We propose that this is a
particularly elegant core language in which to work with recursive
objects, since the potential for general recursion is contained in a
single operator which interacts well with the facilities for bounded
iteration and coiteration.</p>

<p>Labeling techniques for untyped lambda calculus were developed by
L&eacute;vy, Hyland, Wadsworth and others in the 1970's. A typical application
is the proof of confluence from finiteness of developments: by labeling each
subterm with a natural number indicating the maximum number of times this term
may participate in a reduction step, we obtain a strongly-normalizing
approximation of &beta;,&eta;-reduction. Confluence then follows by a syntactic
compactness argument (repeated in the introduction of this paper).</p>
<p>This paper presents applications of labeling to typed lambda calculi with
fixed-point operators, including confluence and completeness of leftmost
reduction for PCF (an applied lambda calculus with fixed-point operators and
numeric and boolean operations) and a confluence proof for a variant of typed
lambda calculus with subtyping. Labeling is simpler for typed calculi than
untyped calculi because the fixed-point operator is the only source of
nontermination. We can also use the method of logical relations for the labeled
typed calculus, extended with basic operations like addition and conditional.
This method would not apply to untyped lambda calculus.</p>

<p>We describe the design and methods of a tool that, based on 
behavioral specifications in interfaces, automatically generates 
simple adaptation functors to overcome minor incompatibilities 
between SML modules. The transformations that get generated can 
be expressed in a small recursion-free sublanguage of SML, namely 
a typed lambda-calculus with function and record types, ML polymorphism, 
first-order type functions and SML equality types. The transformations 
are correct, they transform type- and behaviorally correct implementations 
of an interface A into type- and behaviorally correct implementations of 
an interface B. 

The hope is that a tool of this kind can be useful for automatically
overcoming incompatibilities that result from certain common interface 
changes in the evolution of software systems. Examples are changes 
that generalize functions by adding extra parameters, or changes that 
give functions different, but isomorphic, types. Such changes alter 
the types. The behavioral specifications, on the other hand, remain 
similar, and in many cases the similarities can be automatically 
recognized and the differences automatically overcome. Another possible 
application domain is in automatic library retrieval based on semantic 
specifications.</p>

<p>There are several advantages to introducing a functional language early in
a student's college experience: it provides an excellent setting in which to
explore recursively-defined functions and data structures, it encourages more
abstract thinking, and it exposes students to a language paradigm that is
likely quite different from their previous experience. Even in a core
curriculum based on a traditional imperative (and object-oriented) language,
it is valuable to spend two or three weeks investigating a functional language.
However, we have found that most existing functional languages and environments
pose significant hurdles to the introductory student, especially when the
language is only being used for a short time. This paper discusses some of our
ideas to simplify the framework, and allow students to experiment easily with
the important concepts of functional programming in the setting of CS2.</p>

<p>Learning functional programming is difficult 
for beginning programmers, especially when 
the most common examples come from data 
structures such as lists and trees. We believe an environment that supports working 
with multimedia ob jects, such as graphics 
and music, will help a student learn functional programming in a more efficient and 
productive manner. For this reason, we have 
started development of a set of media libraries in the Scala programming language. 
Our plan is to create an integrated development environment built on Eclipse that
provides access to these tools. In this paper, we 
explain the design of our libraries, which we 
have named the SCALES project, and show 
library functionality by providing examples 
of Sierpinski's Triangle, the Towers of Hanoi, 
and Fr&egrave;re Jacques.</p>

<p>Undergraduate courses in database systems and programming languages are
frequently taught without much overlap. This paper argues that there is a
substantial benefit to emphasizing some areas of commonality, both old and new,
between the two subjects. Examples of such cross-fertilization that may be used
to enhance one or both of the courses include query language design and
implementation, object-relational mapping, transactional memory, and various
aspects of the recent "NoSQL" movement.</p>

<p>It is common to listen to songs that match one’s mood.
Thus, an AI music recommendation system that is aware of the user’s emotions is likely to provide a superior user experience to one that is unaware.
In this paper, we present an emotion-aware music recommendation system.
Multiple models are discussed and evaluated for affect identification from a live image of the user.
We propose two models: DRViT, which applies dynamic routing to vision transformers, and InvNet50, which uses involution.
All considered models are trained and evaluated on the AffectNet dataset.
Each model outputs the user’s estimated valence and arousal under the circumplex model of affect.
These values are compared to the valence and arousal values for songs in a Spotify dataset, and the top-five closest-matching songs are presented to the user.
Experimental results of the models and user testing are presented.</p>
