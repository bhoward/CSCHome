<DT><STRONG>Course Description:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>(from the catalog) This course will explore
techniques for creating and manipulating pictures and sounds through
computer programming. Students will learn the basics of programming in a
modern, high-level language, as well as a variety of methods of
representing, generating, and modifying digital media such as bitmap
images, vector drawings, audio wave files, and MIDI sequences. Classes
will consist of a mixture of lectures, discussions, demonstrations, and
hands-on lab experience. Students will be expected to present some of
the class material, as well as design, execute, and exhibit a final
project using techniques learned in the class.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Grading:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>A satisfactory (S) grade in this class will require an
appropriate level of participation in class, as well as preparation
outside of class.  I will not expect you to become an accomplished
artist or algorithmicist in three weeks, but I will expect you to
develop new skills and the ability to apply them in creative ways.  If
you are already a skilled programmer, then this is your chance to try
some more challenging exercises; if you are already a talented artist,
then this is your chance to explore how to express some of your ideas
with a computer.  If you are already a proficient computer artist, then
you're up first to present something to the class!

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Attendance:</STRONG></DT>
<DD>You are expected to attend all class sessions,
especially since we only have three weeks and you aren't taking any
other classes. However, I expect you to take your own education
seriously, so I do not keep formal attendance records. If you miss a
class, you are responsible for catching up with the material that was
covered and any announcements that were made.
