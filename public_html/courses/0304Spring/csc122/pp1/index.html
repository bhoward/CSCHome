<P>
This assignment is due Friday, February 13, by the start of class.

<P>
Write a program that does the following:

<OL>
<LI>Prompt the user to enter a file name for input.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Open the specified file. If the file doesn't exist, print an error message and exit the program.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Read in all the words from the input file. You may assume that there are no more than 1000 words in the file.

<P>
You may also assume that a ``word'' is a contiguous group of non-white space characters. This sounds complicated, but is really not. For example, in the previous sentence, <code>not.</code> (including the period) would be a word, as would <code>"word"</code> (including the quotation marks) in the sentence before that.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Sort the set of words into alphabetical order. Remember that alphabetical order in C++ means that capitalized words come first, then non-capitalized, etc. Keep in mind that you can compare strings using the same comparison operators (<code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, etc.) that you use with numbers.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Prompt the user to enter a file name for output.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Write the words, in alphabetical order, to the output file.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
Place the work for this assignment in your personal <code>I:\CSC122</code> folder in a folder called <code>HW1</code>. See below for how to create a project from scratch. Turn in a printout of this assignment on the due date in class. There is a file called <code>sample.txt</code> in the <code>public\Howard</code> folder that you can use to test your program.

<P>
There are a number of topics that will be useful for the assignment:

<UL>
<LI>File I/O--<code>fstream</code> variables, etc.
</LI>
<LI>Strings
</LI>
<LI>Arrays
</LI>
<LI>Sorting--bubble or selection sort are the easiest to code, but you can use any algorithm you want, as long as it works.
</LI>
</UL>
You may want to brush up on these, either with your CS1 book or Appendix A in the textbook.

Creating a Microsoft Visual C++ .NET 2003 Project from Scratch</A>
</H2>
From the <code>File</code> menu, choose <code>Project...</code> out of the <code>New</code> submenu.  The ``New Project'' dialog box will appear.  Select <code>Visual C++ Projects</code> from the project types, and <code>Win32 Project</code> from the templates, then enter the correct project location and name in the text boxes; for this assignment, you would enter <code>I:\CSC122\YourName</code> as the location, and <code>HW1</code> as the name.  Click ``OK'' and the ``Win32 Application Wizard'' dialog will appear.  Click on ``Application Settings'' and then select both ``Console Application'' and ``Empty Project''; when you click on ``Finish'' a blank project skeleton will be created.

<P>
In the ``Solution Explorer'' window, right-click on the ``Source Files'' folder and choose <code>Add/Add New Item...</code>; in the dialog that pops up, select <code>C++ File</code> and enter a name (such as <code>main.cpp</code>), then click ``Open''.  An editor window will appear where you can start entering your program.  If you need to add more source files to your project, follow this same process (right-clicking on either ``Source Files'' or ``Header Files'' as appropriate).

<P>
To compile and run your program, first select <code>Build/Build Solution</code> from the menu bar.  If there are no errors, then you may run the program by selecting <code>Debug/Start Without Debugging</code> from the menu bar (this choice causes the program to display the ``Press any key to continue'' message after your program exits, so that you don't need to insert a pause at the end of <code>main</code>).

<P>

Creating a Microsoft Visual C++ 6.0 Project from Scratch</A>
</H2>
From the <code>File</code> menu, choose <code>New...</code>; in the dialog box that appears, make sure the ``Project'' tab is selected, then choose <code>Win32 Console Application</code>.  Enter the correct project name and location in the text boxes; for this assignment, you would enter <code>I:\CSC122\YourName</code> as the location, and then enter <code>HW1</code> as the project name (doing so will also tack on <code>HW1</code> to the end of the location).  Click ``OK'' and the ``Win32 Console Application'' wizard will appear; choose ``An empty project'' and click ``Finish'', then click ``OK'' on the confirmation dialog.

<P>
To add a source file to the project, select <code>File/New...</code> from the menu bar, and make sure the <code>Files</code> tab is selected in the dialog box that appears.  Now choose <code>C++ Source File</code> (or <code>C/C++ Header File</code>, as appropriate), and enter a file name such as <code>main.cpp</code>.  When you click on ``OK'', a blank editor window will appear.

<P>
To compile your project, select <code>Build</code> from the <code>Build</code> menu; to run, select <code>Execute</code> from the <code>Build</code> menu.  As with VC++ .NET 2003, after your program terminates the console will display the message ``Press any key to continue'', so that you don't need to insert a pause at the end of <code>main</code> for testing.

<P>

<H2><A NAME="SECTION00003000000000000000">
Creating a Borland C++ Project from Scratch</A>
</H2>
From the <code>File</code> menu, choose <code>Project...</code> out of the <code>New</code> submenu.  The ``New Target'' dialog box will appear.  Enter the correct project path and name in the first text box; for this assignment, you would enter <code>I:\CSC122\YourName\HW1\hw1.ide</code>.  Make sure that ``Application [.exe]'' is selected under ``Target Type,'' and that the ``Platform'' and ``Target Model'' are ``Win32'' and ``Console'' (it will probably default to ``GUI,'' so you will need to be sure this gets changed).  Now click the ``Advanced'' button and uncheck the boxes labeled <code>.rc</code> and <code>.def</code>, then click ``OK'' twice to make each dialog go away.  Finally, double-click the <code>.cpp</code> node in the project window that appears and you will get an editor window where you can start entering your program.

<P>
To attach additional source files to a project, choose <code>File/New/TextEdit</code> and then <code>File/Save as...</code> from the menu. Give your file an appropriate name in the ``Save File'' dialog and click ``OK.''  Now, in the project window, right-click on the <code>.exe</code> node (at the top) and choose ``Add node'' from the context menu.  This will bring up a file chooser; select the new file you just created and click ``OK.''  The next time you build the project, this new file will be compiled in with the rest of the program.

<P>
To build your project, select <code>Project/Build All</code> from the menu bar; to run, select <code>Debug/Run</code>.  Remember that Borland does not automatically pause after your program executes, so you will need to insert either <code>getch()</code> (defined in <code>conio.h</code>) or <code>cin.get()</code> (defined in <code>iostream</code>) at the end of <code>main</code>.
