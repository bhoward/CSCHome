<dd>Edward Sciore, "Database Management: A Systems Approach using Java," John Wiley &amp; Sons, August 2007 draft</dd>
			
			
<dt>Course Description:</dt>
			
<dd>(from the Catalog) This course provides an external and an internal view of relational database management systems (DBMSs).
			The external view consists of database design and implementation. The database query and manipulation languages SQL and QBE will
			be studied to the degree that students will be able to become proficient in these languages on their own. The internal view
			involves characteristics of secondary storage devices, methods of organizing information, various file organization and
			accessing techniques and other topics related to database engine implementation. Programming assignments complement topics
			discussed in class, including the building of a few key components of a database engine.</dd>
				
			
<dt>Grading:</dt>
			
<dd>The grade for this course will be based on the following:
				<ul>
					
<li>30%: Programming projects (Likely 3 or 4) -- working in pairs OK</li>
					
<li>20%: Homework assignments and quizzes</li>
					
<li>20%: Midterm exam (Thursday, October 4)</li>
					
<li>30%: Final exam (Wednesday, December 12, 1-4 pm)</li>
				
</ul>
			
</dd>
			
			
<dt>Policy Statements:</dt>
			
<dd>
<ul>
				
<li>You are expected to attend all class sessions. However, I
					expect you to take your own education seriously, so I do not
					keep formal attendance records. If you miss a class, you are
					responsible for catching up with the material that was
					covered and any announcements that were made.</li>
				
<li>An important part of this course will be classroom dialogues
					on language design issues, so it is essential that you come
					to class each day prepared to discuss the assigned readings.</li>
				
<li>Homework assignments and programming projects are due by the
					start of class on the assigned date. Late submissions will be
					accepted until the next class time at a penalty of half the
					grade. Extensions will be considered <em>only</em> by prior
					arrangement.</li>
				
<li>Programming projects will be graded on style and efficiency
					as well as correct operation.  To develop as a programmer,
					you are strongly encouraged to do more than the minimum
					assigned amount of work; the best way to learn good style and
					common idioms is to read and write lots of code.</li>
				
<li>Cheating, plagiarism, submission of the work of others, etc.,
					violates the DePauw policy on academic integrity and may
					result in penalties ranging from a lowered grade to course
					failure or expulsion. The policy and discussion of each
					student's obligations and rights are in the Student Handbook.</li>
				
<li>With respect to this course, no collaboration is permitted on
					exams or quizzes. You may discuss homework problems and
					programming assignments with anyone you want (in fact, you are
					encouraged to do so), but you should not copy another
					student's work nor permit your work to be copied. The key idea
					is that you should <em>understand</em> all of the work you turn
					in, and you should be able to replicate it on your own. If you
					do not feel that you can replicate the work independently, then
					it is not fair (to yourself or to others) to submit it as your
					own work. If at any time you are uncertain what constitutes
					"appropriate" collaboration, it is your responsibility to
					clarify it with me.</li>
				
<li>During class time, the computer at your seat should be used for
					note-taking, classroom interaction, and in-class exercises. You
					are not permitted to read e-mail, browse the web, play games,
					etc. while class is in session.</li>
			
</ul>
