    <h2>An Introduction to Haskell</h2>

    <p>Haskell is a modern ``purely functional'' programming
    language. A functional language is one in which functions are
    as easy to manipulate as the more common kinds of values, such
    as numbers and strings. By being <span
    class="textit">purely</span> functional, Haskell does not allow
    the operations which make functions difficult to work with in
    traditional imperative languages: assignment to global
    variables or reference parameters. As a result, calling a
    function will not have any ``side-effects''--that is, it will
    not change the values of any non-local variables--and we are
    free to treat them as pure functions (some texts refer to these
    as ``valued functions'').</p>

    <p>As a higher-level language than C++ or Java, Haskell enables
    programmers to be more productive and write shorter, clearer,
    and more maintanable code. Unfortunately, industry practice has
    not yet embraced functional programming, in part because of the
    enormous effort it would take to retrain current programmers
    and redesign all the support tools. There are signs that the
    industry will gradually move to higher-level languages: for
    example, the next version of Java will contain several new
    language features influenced by the design of Haskell. In the
    meantime, we will study Haskell because it provides a
    convenient and safe (you will appreciate this safety when we
    talk about pointers in C++) setting in which to explore
    recursive functions and data structures.</p>

    <p>Here is an example of Haskell<a id="tex2html1"
    name="tex2html1" href="#foot28"><sup><span
    class="arabic">1</span></sup></a> code to perform the recursive
    Mergesort described in class:</p>
<pre>
merge([ ], ys) = ys
merge(xs, [ ]) = xs
merge([x:xs], [y:ys]) = if x &lt;= y
                        then [ x : merge(xs, [y:ys]) ]
                        else [ y : merge([x:xs], ys) ]

mergesort([ ]) = [ ]
mergesort([x]) = [x]
mergesort(xs)  = let (as, bs) = splitAt(length(xs) # 2, xs)
                 in merge(mergesort(as), mergesort(bs))
</pre>

    <p>After defining these two functions, <code>merge</code> and
    <code>mergesort</code>, one can sort a list by entering a
    command such as <code>mergesort([3,1,4,1,5,9,2,6,5])</code>;
    the result is quickly printed:
    <code>[1,1,2,3,4,5,5,6,9]</code>.</p>

    <p>Even without knowing any details yet of the syntax of
    Haskell, it should be easy to recognize the structure of
    Mergesort in this code. The <code>mergesort</code> function is
    specified by three rules; the first two handle the base cases
    of an empty list or a one-element list, while the third rule
    handles the recursive case by splitting the data into two
    halves, calling <code>mergesort</code> on each half, and then
    merging the results with <code>merge</code>. The
    <code>merge</code> function is also pretty easy to read: if
    either of the lists to be merged is empty, then it just returns
    the other list (first two rules), otherwise it chooses the
    smaller of the two first elements and puts it first in the
    result, followed by another call to <code>merge</code> on the
    remainder of the data. Compare this to the one-and-a-half pages
    of code used for a C++ version of Mergesort in Chapter 9 of
    Carrano &amp; Prichard (which only works on arrays of data up
    to a fixed maximum size--we will see a way around this later,
    but it adds several more lines to the code), and you will
    appreciate the power of higher-level programming provided by
    Haskell.</p>

    <p>There are several points to observe about the Mergesort
    program as we start to learn the details of Haskell. First, the
    program is organized as a sequence of equations defining the
    functions. Unlike the assignment statement in C++, these are
    truly meant to be read as equations. This means that the
    familiar sort of algebraic reasoning by ``substituting equals
    for equals'' will work for Haskell programs. For example,
    consider the following definition of the factorial
    function:</p>
<pre>
factorial(0) = 1
factorial(n) = n * factorial(n-1)
</pre>

    <p>(You are encouraged to try this now in Funnie, as described
    in class and in the companion handout.) We may evaluate the
    result of <code>factorial(4)</code> by using the equations to
    expand the expression as follows:</p>
<pre>
factorial(4) = 4 * factorial(4-1)
             = 4 * factorial(3)
             = 4 * 3 * factorial(2)
             = 4 * 3 * 2 * factorial(1)
             = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 * factorial(0)
             = 4 * 3 * 2 * 1 * 1
             = 24
</pre>

    <p>In Funnie, you may open a ``Stepper Window'' to see this
    sequence of expansions.</p>

    <p>The second point to observe is that the computer will choose
    the first equation that matches the arguments in a particular
    function call. That is, when it evaluates
    <code>factorial(0)</code>, it uses the first equation rather
    than trying to evaluate <code>0 * factorial(-1)</code>. This
    means that we will usually want to handle the special ``base''
    case(s) of functions first in our programs, followed by the
    general recursive case.</p>

    <p>Another observation about the Mergesort program is that it
    works on <span class="textit">lists</span> of data, rather than
    the arrays common in C++. Tied as it is to a specific layout in
    memory (and the corresponding convention of avoiding copying
    that block of memory by passing arrays by reference, which we
    have already seen is a no-no in a purely functional language),
    the array is too low-level a data structure for ordinary use in
    Haskell. As we will see, switching to the more abstract concept
    of a <span class="textit">list</span> of data allows an
    additional level of flexibility in our programming. Here are
    the operations on lists that we need for Mergesort:</p>

    <ul>
      <li>Picking off the first element (the ``head'') of a list.
      This is commonly performed by matching a function argument
      against a <span class="textit">pattern</span> such as
      <code>[x:xs]</code>--read this as matching a list composed of
      the first element <code>x</code> followed by the remainder of
      the list (the other ``<code>x</code>'s''). If you need to
      grab the first element of a list in an expression without
      introducing a new function to use pattern-matching, the
      <code>head</code> function will do the job:
      <code>head([1,2,3])</code> is <code>1</code>.</li>

      <li>Adding a new element at the head of a list. As suggested
      by the pattern form above, this uses the colon
      (<code>:</code>) notation. Therefore, <code>[1 :
      [2,3]]</code> is the list <code>[1,2,3]</code>. Note the
      asymmetrical nature of this operation: the left operand is a
      single value, while the right operand is a list of values. If
      you want to concatenate two lists together, use the
      <code>++</code> operator: <code>[1,2] ++ [3,4]</code>
      produces <code>[1,2,3,4]</code>.</li>

      <li>Constructing an empty list or a single-element list. The
      empty list is written <code>[ ]</code>, while a list
      consisting of just the value <code>x</code> is written
      <code>[x]</code>. As we have seen, this notation extends to
      arbitrarily long lists by putting a comma-separated list of
      values between the brackets. This is all an abbreviation;
      what the computer is really thinking when you write
      <code>[1,2,3]</code> is <code>[1 : [2 : [3 : [
      ]]]]</code>--that is, start with the empty list and
      successively prepend the values <code>3</code>, then
      <code>2</code>, and finally <code>1</code> at the head.</li>

      <li>
        Getting the length of a list and splitting it into two
        sublists. These operations are not directly built into the
        language, but rather are provided as part of the ``Standard
        Prelude'' of commonly used functions (think of the common
        functions defined in C++ headers such as
        <code>&lt;iostream&gt;</code> or
        <code>&lt;string&gt;</code>, or the classes defined in
        standard Java packages such as <code>java.lang</code> or
        <code>java.io</code>). We could write these functions
        ourselves--for example, here is a definition of
        <code>length</code>: 
<pre>
length([ ]) = 0
length([x:xs]) = 1 + length(xs)
</pre>
        --but they are used so frequently that people have
        assembled a standard collection of functions that are
        always available (without even needing the equivalent of a
        <code>#include</code> or <code>import</code>...).
      </li>
    </ul>
