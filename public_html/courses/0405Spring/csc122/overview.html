      <dd>Jaime Ni&ntilde;o and Frederick A. Hosch, "An
      Introduction to Programming and Object Oriented Design Using
      Java Version 5.0" (second edition), John Wiley &amp; Sons,
      2005, ISBN: 0-471-71227-2</dd>

      <dt>Course Description:</dt>

      <dd>This course is composed of two sets of overlapping and
      complementary ideas: the art and science of program
      development, and fundamental concepts from computer science.
      This course builds on CSC 121 and introduces programming
      topics such as sets, recursion, and dynamic data types. Data
      type abstraction and implementation are introduced by
      studying structures such as lists, stacks, queues, and binary
      trees. The object-oriented implementation of these structures
      is emphasized. Tools for algorithm analysis are introduced,
      and comparisons of functional, object-oriented, and
      imperative programming paradigms are made. The concept of
      tradeoffs, i.e., time vs. space, iteration vs. recursion,
      static vs. dynamic, and imperative vs. functional, recurs as
      a theme throughout the course. A large part of the outside
      work associated with the course will involve assignments
      designed to enhance lecture concepts.</dd>

      <dt>Grading:</dt>

      <dd>
        The grade for this course will be based on the following: 

        <ul>
          <li>30%: Programming projects</li>

          <li>10%: Homework assignments and quizzes</li>

          <li>35%: Midterm exams (Wednesday, March 2 and Wednesday,
          April 13, at <b>7 pm</b>)</li>

          <li>25%: Final exam</li>
        </ul>
      </dd>

      <dt>Policy Statements:</dt>

      <dd>
        <ul>
          <li>You are expected to attend all class sessions.
          However, I expect you to take your own education
          seriously, so I do not keep formal attendance records. If
          you miss a class, you are responsible for catching up
          with the material that was covered and any announcements
          that were made.</li>

          <li>Homework assignments are due at the start of class
          and programming projects are due by 5 pm on the assigned
          date. Late submissions will be accepted until the next
          class time at a penalty of half the grade. Extensions
          will be considered <em>only</em> by prior
          arrangement.</li>

          <li>Programming projects will be graded on style and
          efficiency as well as correct operation. To develop as a
          programmer, you are strongly encouraged to do more than
          the minimum assigned amount of work; the best way to
          learn good style and common idioms is to read and write
          lots of code.</li>

          <li>Cheating, plagiarism, submission of the work of
          others, etc., violates the DePauw policy on academic
          integrity and may result in penalties ranging from a
          lowered grade to course failure or expulsion. The policy
          and discussion of each student's obligations and rights
          are in the Student Handbook.</li>

          <li>With respect to this course, no collaboration is
          permitted on exams or quizzes. You may discuss homework
          problems and programming assignments with anyone you want
          (in fact, you are encouraged to do so), but you should
          not copy another student's work nor permit your work to
          be copied. The key idea is that you should
          <em>understand</em> all of the work you turn in, and you
          should be able to replicate it on your own. If you do not
          feel that you can replicate the work independently, then
          it is not fair (to yourself or to others) to submit it as
          your own work. If at any time you are uncertain what
          constitutes "appropriate" collaboration, it is your
          responsibility to clarify it with me.</li>

          <li>Exams in this course will be closed-book and
          closed-notes, and will cover lectures and assigned
          readings. More information will be available prior to
          each exam. The examinations during the semester will be
          given in the evening, concurrently with the other
          section.</li>

          <li>During class time, the computer at your seat should
          be used for note-taking, classroom interaction, and
          in-class exercises. You are not permitted to read e-mail,
          browse the web, play games, etc. while class is in
          session.</li>
