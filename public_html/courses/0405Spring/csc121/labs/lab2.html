    <h3>Laboratory 2 - Modifying and Examining Object State</h3>

    <dl>
      <dt>Goals:</dt>

      <dd>To understand how selection statements can be used to
      control the behavior of graphics objects; To create/modify
      accessor, mutator, and general methods; To experiment with
      the interaction of graphics objects that are controlled by a
      "driver class"; To create a BlueJ project from scratch; To
      use print statements for elementary debugging.</dd>

      <dt>Getting started:</dt>

      <dd>
        <ul>
          <li>Copy the folder Lab2 from the public folder on the I:
          drive to your class folder on the I: drive.</li>

          <li>Start up BlueJ</li>
        </ul>
      </dd>

      <dt>The Steps of the Lab:</dt>

      <dd>
        <ol>
          <li><strong>Work through exercises 2.72 and 2.73 in your
          textbook. (When you create the heater project, save it in
          the Lab2 folder on your I: drive)</strong></li>

          <li>
            <strong>Close the heater-exercise project and open the
            shapes project.</strong> 

            <table border="1" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0"
            summary="Sequence of steps">
              <tr align="left" valign="top">
                <td><strong>Read</strong></td>

                <td>Open the editor for the Circle class. Read
                through the class definition making note of the
                fields and the methods. Do the same for the
                Triangle class.</td>
              </tr>

              <tr align="left" valign="top">
                <td><strong>Modify</strong></td>

                <td>
                  <p>If you invoke any of the move methods for
                  Circle and Triangle objects repeatedly the
                  objects will eventually move out of their display
                  window and disappear.</p>

                  <p>You can prevent this from happening by
                  modifying the moveHorizontal and moveVertical
                  methods of the circle and triangle classes so
                  that those objects will never move off of the
                  Canvas. Why will modifying only these two methods
                  cause some of the other move methods to have the
                  desired result? Which ones will not have the
                  desired result?</p>

                  <p><strong>NOTE: Do not be concerned that the
                  objects stop moving precisely when they are at an
                  edge. Being close to an edge (or even slightly
                  over the edge) is good enough.</strong></p>

                  <p>You will need to write a selection statement
                  (if-else) for each of the methods, moveHorizontal
                  and moveVertical in each class, Circle and
                  Triangle. Each method should determine the
                  position of the figure and either move the figure
                  or not move it if it is too close to a boundary.
                  Again, you decide just how close the figure may
                  come to the boundary; it does not need to be
                  precisely at the edge.</p>

                  <p>The left boundary of the canvas in the
                  horizontal direction is 0 and the top boundary in
                  the vertical direction is 0. You can use the
                  getWidth() and getHeight() methods of the
                  <strong>canvas</strong> field in each class of
                  object to determine window boundaries. (Note that
                  canvas is one of the fields for a Circle and a
                  Triangle.) So to get the dimensions of the canvas
                  use:</p>
<pre>
    canvas.getWidth();
    canvas.getHeight();
                               
</pre>

                  <p>Both of these methods return int values.</p>

                  <p>Drawing a picture of an object near a screen
                  boundary should help you decide when to not move
                  the object because it is too close to one of the
                  boundaries.</p>

                  <p>Make sure you thoroughly test by trying to
                  move an object off of the screen before moving to
                  the next step of the lab.</p>

                <td>
                  <p>Create a new method, moveDirection, for the
                  Circle and Triangle classes which has the
                  signature:</p>
<pre>
public void moveDirection(int distanceX, int distanceY)
                               
</pre>

                  <p>There are several ways to do this, but we will
                  examine only one of them.</p>

                  <p><strong>Using moveHorizontal and
                  moveVertical:</strong> Simply invoke each of
                  these methods in the body of moveDirection,
                  giving each the appropriate parameter --
                  distanceX to moveHorizontal and distanceY to
                  moveVertical.</p>

                  <p>Test moveDirection before going on to the next
                  step. Invoke it several times, and carefully
                  watch the shape move on the canvas. How could
                  moveDirection be written differently to make it
                  work better? (You do not need to write a
                  different version now; just think about how you
                  would do it.)</p>

                <td>
                  <p>Write a new method, displayState(), that
                  prints all of the fields of a circle object in a
                  terminal window. Note that this is the same
                  information that is displayed by the BlueJ
                  inspector window (right-click on an object in
                  BlueJ and choose "Inspect").</p>

                  <p>Test the method by invoking it, changing a
                  circle state variable, invoking displayState()
                  again, and so on.</p>

                  <p>Open the driver class. Note its fields and
                  what the constructor does. Create an instance of
                  the driver class, observing where the ball and
                  rocket are displayed. Add code to the moveAway()
                  method to call moveDirection on the circle and
                  triangle to cause them to move away from each
                  other. See the comments for the moveAway() method
                  to find hints for how this should work.</p>
