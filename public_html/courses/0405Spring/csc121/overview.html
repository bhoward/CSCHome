<dt>Course description:</dt>

<dd>This is a course in which students are introduced to several
broad areas of computer science as a means to motivate problem
solving using tools of the discipline: design of algorithms,
representation of data, and implementation of algorithms as
computer programs. Areas studied include graphics and graphical
user interfaces, modeling and simulation, artificial intelligence,
information management, and the world wide web. Interesting and
relevant programming projects are written in a computer language
that supports object-oriented design and programming. More general
topics, such as the history of computing and related ethical
issues, may also be considered. This course or its equivalent is a
prerequisite for anyone who will major or minor in computer
science.</dd>

<dt>Course content:</dt>

<dd>It is important to understand that no one resource provides all
of the content for the course. We will rely heavily on the
textbook, but lectures will often contain material that will not be
in the text. Likewise the labs will often contain material that is
neither in the textbook nor the lecture. So, to get the most from
this course you should actively participate in all of its
parts.</dd>

<dt>Caveat:</dt>

<dd>This semester will be the second offering of this course in a
new format. We will be using the modern approach of object oriented
programming and design within the popular Java programming
environment. Java can be used to write desktop applications and
various applications associated with the World Wide Web. We are
also taking a slightly different approach to homework, laboratory
exercises and assignments than in the past. We have kept the best
aspects of the former version of Computer Science I, which has been
a very popular course for the past twelve years. We are excited and
enthusiastic about the new course, but at the same time we are
realistic enough to know that there will likely be a few glitches
during the semester. We faculty members will be having weekly
meetings to assess the state of the course. In addition we
encourage you to let us, the lab instructor or the lab assistants
know early on when you detect that something about the course is
broken.</dd>

<dt>Textbook:</dt>

<dd><em>Objects First With Java, Second Edition</em>, by David J.
Barnes and Michael K&ouml;lling, Prentice Hall, ISBN
0-13-124933-9</dd>

<dt>Course Web Site:</dt>

<dd><a href=
"."><code>http://www.csc.depauw.edu/~bhoward/courses/0405Spring/csc121/</code></a></dd>

<dt>Assignments:</dt>

<dd>The course grade will be based on exams plus a variety of
assignments, including homework, in-class work, quizzes, and
programming projects. Homework and in-class assignments will
typically be associated with exercises from the textbook or
worksheets prepared by your instructor. Quizzes may occur
frequently and may or may not be announced in advance, depending on
your instructor. Programming projects, sometimes worked on by pairs
of students, will require significant time out of class, although
parts of Tuesday labs will occasionally be used to work on these.
Generally, the three or so labs preceeding the programming project
due date will help you develop the skills required for the
project.</dd>

<dt>Tuesday Labs:</dt>

<dd>The lab atmosphere is a relaxed one, where interactions among
students, and between student and instructor/lab assistants, are
encouraged. Lab activities are designed to complement and extend
topics discussed in the classroom. The grade for each lab will be
based on successful completion of the lab itself; <em>you must have
your work checked off by the instructor or a lab assistant by no
later than the start of the next week's lab.</em> All deviations
from this policy must be approved by the lab instructor (Ron
Croonenberg).</dd>

<dt>Laboratory Instructor and Student Assistants:</dt>

<dd>Ron Croonenberg is the laboratory instructor and coordinator.
His office is 275 Julian. His email address is
<code>ronc@depauw.edu</code>. All administrative questions about
the laboratories should be directed to him first. Student
assistants will have evening office hours prior to project due
dates. The assistants will write their names on the whiteboards in
the Julian labs, to indicate their presence.</dd>

<dt>Technical information:</dt>

<dd>We will be programming in Java, using the BlueJ environment
that is bundled on a CD with your textbook. BlueJ is available in
the computer labs on campus. If you have your own computer you are
also allowed to install BlueJ on it. Instructions for this are in
Appendix A.1 of your textbook. You can also install the most recent
version from the Internet by going to <a href=
"http://www.bluej.org/"><code>http://www.bluej.org</code></a></dd>

<dt>Exam dates:</dt>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>Exam 1: Wednesday, March 2, 7:00 p.m.</li>

<li>Exam 2: Wednesday, April 13, 7:00 p.m.</li>

<li>Final Exam date and time is dependent on your course
section</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>Grading:</dt>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>Exams and Quizzes: 60% (distribution determined by your
instructor)</li>

<li>Programming Projects: 20% (4% each)</li>

<li>Computer Labs: 10%</li>

<li>Other assignments: 10%</li>

<li>Grading Scale: A (93-100), A- (90-92), B+ (87-89), B (83-86),
B- (80-82), C+ (77-79), C (73-76), C- (70-72), D+ (67-69), D
(63-66), D- (60-62), F(0-59)</li>

<li>Q-credit: a C average on all exams <strong>and</strong> a C
average on labs, projects, and assignments</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>Important notes:</dt>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>You must have taken UNIV101 or be qualified to enroll in a Q
course to enroll in this course.</li>

<li>CSC121 satisfies group one, however, it is <strong>not</strong>
a group one laboratory course. There is no group one laboratory
credit for this course.</li>
