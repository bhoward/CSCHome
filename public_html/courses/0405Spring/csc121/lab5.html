<h2>Lab 5</h2>

<h3>Laboratory 5 - GUI Design and Project 2</h3>

<dl>
<dt>Goals:</dt>

<dd>To gain experience with swing components and event handling. To
complete the look and some functionality of project 2, where we
will create a calculator program with a graphical user interface
(GUI).</dd>

<dt>Getting started:</dt>

<dd>
<ul>
<li>Copy the folder Lab5 from the public folder on the I: drive to
your class folder on the I: drive.</li>

<li>Start up BlueJ</li>
</ul>
</dd>

<dt>The Steps of the Lab:</dt>

<dd>
<ol>
<li><strong>Open the gui-practice project</strong> 

<table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" summary=
"Sequence of steps">
<tr align="left" valign="top">
<td><strong>Read</strong></td>
<td>The PracticeGUI class uses several GUI components from the
swing library: 

<ul>
<li><b>A frame:</b> see makeFrame()</li>

<li><b>A menu:</b> see makeMenuBar()</li>

<li><b>Labels:</b> see makeLabel() - note the formal
parameters</li>

<li><b>Buttons:</b> see makeButton() - note the formal
parameters</li>

<li><b>A panel:</b> see makePanel() - This is for the CENTER
content of the BorderLayout manager</li>

<li><b>Radio buttons:</b> see makeRadioButton() - note the formal
parameters</li>
</ul>

<p>Note that each of the methods are private. This is because in
this particular case none of these methods are to be used by other
classes.</p>

<p>Note also that some of these methods call other methods. For
example makeFrame calls makeMenuBar and makePanel calls
makeRadioButton. This is done for a couple of reasons: 1) To reuse
code. makeButton and makeRadioButton are each called two times and
2) to allow the length of code in methods to be relatively short
for readability. We could have reduced the number of methods
considerably and put all of the code in makeFrame, but then
makeFrame would be much longer and harder to read.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr align="left" valign="top">
<td><strong>Create</strong></td>
<td>
<p>Create an instance of PracticeGUI and observe the initial
display. Reconcile the display with the code that produced it. Why,
for example, does the OK button appear on the left side of the
window? Or the Radio Buttons in the center?</p>

<p>Click on the various clickable components and observe the
results.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr align="left" valign="top">
<td><strong>Add</strong></td>
<td>
<p>Add a new label to the layout. This should be done in the
makeFrame method, and you should use the method makeLabel to do it.
Make the caption to the label "PracticeGUI: Fun with GUI" and add
it to the NORTH region of the layout. The variable you use for this
label should be local to makeFrame.</p>

<p>Note the fields of the class: frame, frameContentPane,
stateLabel, rbOne, rbTwo, and buttonOKClicks. There are several
other components in the class that are used, but are not declared
as fields. This is because they are not modified directly by the
class. The label you just made, for example, will never change
during the life of the class, so there is no need to make it a
field of the class.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr align="left" valign="top">
<td><strong>Add</strong></td>
<td>
<p>When you clicked the OK button, a count of the number of times
it had been clicked was displayed in the bottom label of the GUI.
This did not happen when the NOT OK button was clicked. Modify the
class by adding a new field, <b>buttonNotOKClicks</b>, so that the
number of times this button is clicked will be reported too. You
will need to modify the actionPerformed(ActionEvent event) method
and make changes in a couple of other places too.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr align="left" valign="top">
<td><strong>Modify</strong></td>
<td>
<p>You may have noticed that clicking on a RadioButton more than
one time in a row, causes the button to be selected and then not
selected. But the RadioButton label and the label in SOUTH both
indicate that is it selected. Modify the actionPerformed method so
that the RadioButton is actually black (selected) whenever it is
clicked.</p>
</td>
</tr>

<tr align="left" valign="top">
<td><strong>Complete</strong></td>
<td>
<p>Work with your partner to start the project 2 calculator
program. The initial version of this project is in the Lab5 folder
and called <b>calculator.</b> It is a working calculator that does
addition and subtraction. The goal is to take the GUI on the left
in the figure below and add /, *, (, and ) buttons to achieve the
look on the right. Don't worry about the caption on the bottom of
the calculator GUI at this point.</p>

<p>Once you have the new buttons located in the correct position,
add else-if statements in the actionPerformed method to handle the
/and * buttons. Do not worry about the ( and ) buttons now. To do
this you will be modifying the UserInterface class by adding calls
to calc.mult() and calc.divide().</p>

<p>Next, add code to the <b>CalcEngine</b> class to have a working
calculator with all of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and
division finished. To do this, add the mult() and divide() methods
to the CalcEngine class imitating plus() and minus() methods.
Lastly, modify the calcResult() method in CalcEngine to fill in the
calculation required for * and /. Don't forget that division by 0
is not legal and if the denominator is 0 you should set the result
to 0 and report an error using System.out.println. The code in
calcResult to modify is:</p>

<pre>
        switch (operator) {
        case '+':
            result = intLVal + intRVal;
            break;
            
        case '-':
            result = intLVal - intRVal;
            break;
            
        case '*':
            // Mult code goes here
            break;
            
        case '/':
            // Divide code goes here
            break;
            
        default:
            keySequenceError();
            break;
        }
                           
</pre>
