Getting Started with Unix</A>
</H1>

<P>
This tutorial is for those who have never used Unix before. It covers
only the most essential commands that you need to begin with and
indicates where to look to learn more. It is assumed that you have this
document in printed form so that you can go through the steps on the
computer as you read.</P>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Log In</STRONG></DT>
<DD>
<P>
To begin with, you need to log in to oort or one of the Linux
machines in Julian 276. If you want to log in from across the network,
use <code>ssh oort.csc.depauw.edu</code> (on Windows you will need to install a client such as
<code>PuTTY</code>, available from
<A HREF="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/</A>).  For a graphical
interface, use the X-Win32 program installed on the campus lab PCs.  An excellent free alternative for Windows is Xming
(<A HREF="http://www.straightrunning.com/XmingNotes/"><TT>http://www.straightrunning.com/XmingNotes/</TT></A>).  On Mac OS X,
you should already have <code>ssh</code> and X Windows installed; talk to me if you need help using these.</P>

<P>
You will need the username and password from the sheet I gave you (and you will
probably want to change the password to something more memorable, with the
<code>kpasswd</code> command).</P>
</DD>

<DT><STRONG>The unix prompt</STRONG></DT>
<DD>
<P>
Unix is fundamentally a command-line operating system. If you are logged in
with an X Windows session (either in 276 or by using X-Win32), you will see
a familiar windowed interface, but this is just a front-end for the underlying
system. To do much of your work, you will need to open one or more ``Terminal''
windows.</P>

<P>
To make it go, you have to type in commands at what is called ``the unix
prompt''. The prompt is usually the name of the host followed by a
dollar sign, but it varies depending on how the system administrator
has set it up. When the cursor is on the line with this prompt, unix is
awaiting your command. In the examples below, we will assume the 
prompt is ``<code>oort$</code>''. You do not type the prompt; you type what comes
after it.</P>
</DD>

<DT><STRONG>Some Essential Commands</STRONG></DT>
<DD>
<P>
Here is a walking tour of some essential unix commands:</P>

<OL>
<LI><code>oort$ ls</code>
<BR>
This shows a list of the files in the current directory. You might not
have any files yet, so let's make one.
</LI>

<LI><code>oort$ cp /proc/version version</code>
<BR>
This copies an existing file into the current directory. You own the
copy.
</LI>

<LI><code>oort$ ls</code>
<BR>
You should now see ``<code>version</code>'' among any other files that you have.
</LI>

<LI><code>oort$ ls -l</code>
<BR>
Unix commands usually have options to modify how the command behaves.
Options are usually specified by a hyphen followed by a single letter.
In this case the ``<code>-l</code>'' option specifies that you want a ``long''
listing, which shows lots more information that just the file name.
</LI>

<LI><code>oort$ cat version</code>
<BR>
This prints the contents of the file. It describes some of the details of the
version of unix (actually, linux) that we are running. If a new version is
installed, the original file will change. But the copy that you just made is
yours and does not change until you change it yourself.
</LI>

<LI><code>oort$ pwd</code>
<BR>
This shows the ``present working directory''. Unless you have gotten way
ahead of me, this is your ``home directory''. You own this directory.
You can create new files in you home directory and modify and delete
them at will. Other users on the system have their own home directories,
and you cannot mess with their files unless they explicitly grant
permissions that allow you access to them.
<BR>
<BR>
Take a close look at the output of the <code>pwd</code> command. This is what is
called a ``path'' in unix. Unix organizes files in one big tree, where
each node of the tree has a name. The path is the sequence of nodes the
system needs to follow to get from the root of the tree to your home
directory.
</LI>

<LI><code>oort$ mkdir xyz</code>
<BR>
You can build up the unix directory tree starting from your home
directory. The <code>mkdir</code> command makes a new directory. Let's see where unix
put it.
</LI>

<LI><code>oort$ ls</code>
<BR>
The <code>xyz</code> directory is within your home directory. Directories can contain
directories as well as files! You can now put files in the <code>xyz</code>
directory.
</LI>

<LI><code>oort$ cd xyz</code>
<BR>
This changes your current working directory to the <code>xyz</code> subdirectory.
</LI>

<LI><code>oort$ pwd</code>
<BR>
Notice that the <code>xyz</code> node has been added to the path.
</LI>

<LI><code>oort$ cat version</code>
<BR>
This results in an error because there is no file called <code>version</code> in the
current directory.
</LI>

<LI><code>oort$ emacs tutorial</code>
<BR>
Type the current paragraph of this tutorial. Use the cursor keys to move
the cursor around. Use backspace to correct mistakes. When you are
finished hit `Control-X Control-S' to save the file and then `Control-X
Control-C' to quit (if you are using X Windows, you may also perform these
actions by selecting menu actions or clicking on toolbar icons). You
should now be out of <code>emacs</code> and back at the unix prompt.
</LI>

<LI><code>oort$ ls</code>
<BR>
The <code>ls</code> command shows the files in the current directory, which is
the <code>xyz</code> subdirectory. So the files in your home directory do not
appear. The only file that show up at this point is the file that you
just created with the text editor.
</LI>

<LI><code>oort$ cd ..</code>
<BR>
The double-period designation in this command is unix notation for the
``parent directory''.
</LI>

<LI><code>oort$ pwd</code>
<BR>
You should now be back at your home directory. When you said ``<code>cd ..</code>'',
the current directory moved from <code>xyz</code> to its parent, which is your
home directory. The <code>xyz</code> directory is a ``subdirectory'' of your home
directory. The home directory is the ``parent'' of <code>xyz</code>. A directory may
contain any number of subdirectories, but a directory has one and only
one parent. (Exception: the root directory, whose name is just <code>/</code>, has no parent.)
</LI>

<LI><code>oort$ mv version oldversion</code>
<BR>
This moves the file. In this case that means that the name of the file
is changed.
</LI>

<LI><code>oort$ ls</code>
<BR>
Note that <code>version</code> is gone, but <code>oldversion</code> is now there. It is the same
file, but with a different name.
</LI>

<LI><code>oort$ mv oldversion xyz</code>
<BR>
This is different from the previous <code>mv</code> because the destination is a
directory.
</LI>

<LI><code>oort$ cd xyz</code>
</LI>

<LI><code>oort$ ls</code>
<BR>
Note that <code>oldversion</code> has been moved into the <code>xyz</code>
subdirectory.
</LI>

<LI><code>oort$ cat version</code>
<BR>
Again this results in an error because there is no file called
<code>version</code> in the current directory. But we know that there is a file
named <code>version</code> somewhere in the tree. How do we access it?
</LI>

<LI><code>oort$ cat /proc/version</code>
<BR>
You can always give the ``full path'' name of a file regardless of the
current directory. Full path names begin with a slash (<code>/</code>) and list all
of the nodes in the path from the root directory to the file. In this
case the path is short, but in general there may be many nodes to type.
</LI>

<LI><code>oort$ cd</code>
<BR>
Sometimes you just want to get back to your home directory. The <code>cd</code> with
no arguments does exactly that.
</LI>

<LI><code>oort$ ls xyz</code>
<BR>
This lists the files in the <code>xyz</code> directory.
</LI>

<LI><code>oort$ cat xyz/oldversion</code>
<BR>
This displays the contents of the <code>oldversion</code> file. This command
illustrates what is called a ``relative path'' name of a file. Since the
path does not begin with a slash (<code>/</code>), the system follows the specified
tree nodes beginning with the current directory. So the path is relative
to the current directory.
</LI>

<LI><code>oort$ ls ..</code>
<BR>
The relative path may contain ``<code>..</code>'' to access the parent
directory. This command therefore shows what is in the parent of your
home directory (probably a bunch of other people's home directories).
</LI>

<LI><code>oort$ man ls</code>
<BR>
There are many, many commands on a unix system. The printed manual that
explains the syntax and options for each command is several volumes in
size (and very expensive). But the manual pages are installed on-line on
most systems. The <code>man</code> command takes the name of a command or program as
its argument. It displays the manual page for that command or program.
In this case, you see the <code>man</code> page for the <code>ls</code> command.
<BR>
<BR>
When you are in the <code>man</code> display, use the following commands:

<DT><STRONG>Explore <TT>man</TT> pages</STRONG></DT>

<P>
Now that you know about the <code>man</code> command, you can find out about other
important unix commands. What you should do now is read the <code>man</code> pages in
the list of must-know commands below. These give a lot more detail than
what you need to know to get started, but read the description of what
the command does and skim the rest just to see what information is
available.</P>
