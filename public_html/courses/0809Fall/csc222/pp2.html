<h1>CSC 222: Data Structures and Algorithms, Fall 2008</h1>
	
<h2>Programming Project 2</h2>
	
		
<p>
			This project will be due by 5 pm, Friday, October 3. To submit your
			project, save it in a directory named
			<code>pp2</code>
			under your directory in 
			<code>/home/libs/dataStr/students/</code>
			on one of the department's Linux machines (this is a shared
			directory, so you should be able to reach it from any of the
			machines, including oort).
		</p>

		
<p>
			You may work on this project by yourself or in a group of two or
			three. If you work in a group, be sure to include everyone's name in
			the comments at the top of <i>each</i>
			file. Also, be sure you understand the guidelines for group work
			listed in the syllabus--the fundamental idea is that everyone in the
			group should understand what everyone else has done, and be able to
			recreate it on their own.
		</p>

		
<p>
			You should start by creating your <code>pp2</code>
			directory and copying the starter files into it (the following commands
			assume that you start in your directory under
			<code>/home/libs/dataStr/students/</code>):
		</p>
		
<pre>
mkdir pp2
cd pp2
cp /home/libs/dataStr/pp2/* .
		</pre>

		
<p>
			The project is to create an interpreter for a tiny programming language
			reminiscent of (old-style) BASIC.  Given a program such as this:
		</p>
		
<pre>
10 X = 10
15 foo = 17
20 a = X * X - foo
25 X = ( X + 1 ) / 3
		</pre>
		
<p>
			your interpreter will execute the statements in sequence, then print out
			the final values of all the variables:
		</p>
		
<pre>
X = 3
a = 83
foo = 17
		</pre>
		
<p>
			This is a very simple subset of BASIC; later in the semester, we will discuss how
			to extend this subset to handle statements other than assignment (such as
			<code>INPUT</code> and <code>PRINT</code>, to allow some kind of I/O, and
			<code>IF</code> and <code>GOTO</code>, to allow non-linear program
			flow...).
		</p>
		
		
<p>
			In more detail, your program will present the user with an "interpreter
			prompt," where they can either enter/modify program statements or give
			commands such as <code>RUN</code> to execute the program, or <code>LIST</code>
			to display the current program.  If a command starts with a positive integer,
			it will cause that numbered line to be added to the program (possibly replacing
			a previous line with the same number).  Otherwise, it will be treated as an
			immediate command: you will need to handle <code>RUN</code> and <code>LIST</code>,
			as mentioned, plus <code>QUIT</code> to exit the interpreter (this is already
			done in the provided code); for convenience, you may also want to handle commands such as
			<code>LOAD "file"</code> and <code>SAVE "file"</code>, so that you don't have to
			keep typing in lots of statements when testing.  Here is a sample interaction
			(the user's input is after the <code>&gt; </code> prompt):
		</p>
		
<pre>
&gt; 10 X = 10
&gt; 20 a = X * X - 17
&gt; RUN
X = 10
a = 83
Done
&gt; 20 a = X * X - foo
&gt; 15 foo = 17
&gt; LIST
10 X = 10
15 foo = 17
20 a = ( ( X * X ) - foo )
&gt; RUN
X = 10
a = 83
foo = 17
Done
&gt; 25 X = ( X + 1 ) / 3
&gt; RUN
X = 3
a = 83
foo = 17
Done
&gt; QUIT
		</pre>
		
		
<p>
			Here are some comments about the above interaction:
		</p>
		
<ul>
			
<li>The line numbers enable a crude form of program editing, since you can go back
			and insert statements (such as 15) between existing lines, as long as there is a
			gap between their numbers, and you can modify lines (such as 20) by replacing the
			old version.</li>
			
<li>At the end of running the program, all variables assigned during execution are
			printed out along with their final values.  Variables are printed in alphabetical
			order, according to the ASCII rule where all upper-case letters precede lower-case
			(so capital 'X' comes before little 'a').</li>
			
<li>Each "token" (variable, constant, operator, or punctuation) must be surrounded by
			spaces.  Variables are words starting with an alphabetic letter (A-Z and a-z), constants
			start with a digit (0-9), and everything else is an operator or punctuation (+, -, *,
			/, =, and parentheses).</li>
			
<li>Arithmetic is done entirely on integers; for example, <code>11 / 3</code> produces
			the result 3.</li>
			
<li>Listing the program includes superfluous parentheses, partly because it is easier
			(hint: write an inorder traversal which prints "(", the left subexpression, the operator,
			the right subexpression, and ")"; in the base case, just print the variable or constant),
			and partly so that you can make sure your parser is getting the precedences correct.</li>
		
</ul>
			
		
<p>
			There are two main parts to the project: parsing and execution.  The following sections
			deal with each in more detail.
		</p>
		
	
<h3>Parsing</h3>
	
	
<p>
		The constructor for the <code>Statement</code> class is passed a buffer of strings
		containing the current line (excluding the line number, which has already been extracted).
		A buffer is simply an STL <code>queue&lt;string&gt;</code>, so you may use the <code>front()</code> and <code>pop()</code>
		methods as usual to look at and erase the next available word.
	</p>
	
	
<p>
		For an assignment statement, you may assume that the first word in the buffer will be the
		name of the variable to be assigned, and the second word will be an equal sign.  For this
		project, you may ignore error cases (for extra credit, augment your interpreter with
		appropriate handling of the various syntactic errors that might occur).  The remaining
		words will be the right-hand-side expression.  The <code>Statement</code> constructor
		should record the variable name and the expression tree (see below) in private fields.
	</p>
	
	
<p>
		Parsing the expression will result in an expression tree.  This will be a binary tree
		where each of the interior nodes is labeled by an operator, whose children are
		the operands of that operator.  Leaf nodes will be variable names or constants (stored
		as strings, just as they are read in from the buffer).  For example, the expression
		<code>( X + 1 ) / 3</code> will turn into the following tree:
	</p>
	
<pre>
    "/"
    / \
  "+" "3"
  / \
"X" "1"
	</pre>
	
	
<p>
		Here is pseudocode for the operator-precedence parsing algorithm.  It makes use of two stacks:
		a "nouns" stack which contains pointers to tree nodes, and a "verbs" stack which contains
		strings.
	</p>
	
<pre>

<b>for each</b> token from the buffer:
  <b>if</b> the token is a variable or constant,
    push a new leaf node containing the token on the nouns stack;
  <b>else if</b> the token is a left parenthesis,
    push a left parenthesis on the verbs stack;
  <b>else if</b> the token is a right parenthesis,
    <b>while</b> the top of the verbs stack is not a left parenthesis:
      REDUCE;
    pop the left parenthesis from the verbs stack;
  <b>else</b>:
    <b>while</b> the verbs stack is not empty <b>and</b> the top of the verbs stack has precedence &gt;= the token:
      REDUCE;
    push the token on the verbs stack;
<b>while</b> the verbs stack is not empty:
  REDUCE;
<b>return</b> the top of the nouns stack.
	</pre>
	
<p>
		The <code>REDUCE</code> operation pops an operator from the verbs stack and two operands
		from the nouns stack (right operand first, then left), then pushes a new tree node back
		on the nouns stack containing that operator and operands.  The precedence levels should
		be set so that left parenthesis has the lowest precedence, then the additive operators (+
		and -) have the next level, and the multiplicative operators (* and /) have the highest.
		Of course, you may add more operators and give them corresponding precedence levels; this
		is just the minimum you should support.
	</p>
	
	
<h3>Execution</h3>
	
	
<p>
		Each <code>Statement</code> object has an <code>execute</code> method which takes a
		context and a program iterator.  In the provided code, all that it does is increment
		the iterator and return.  You will need to add code to evaluate the expression tree and
		store the resulting value in the context.
	</p>
	
	
<p>
		The context is an STL map from strings (variable names) to integers (their current values).
		Therefore, you may treat it as an array indexed by the variable names, so
		<code>context["X"]</code> gives you the current value of <code>X</code> (or 0, if
		<code>X</code> has not yet been assigned), and <code>context["foo"] = 17;</code>
		enters 17 as the new value for <code>foo</code>.
	</p>
	
	
<p>
		Evaluating an expression tree is simply a postorder traversal of the tree: evaluate the
		left child to get an integer, evaluate the right child to get another integer, and then
		perform the operation specified in the parent node (just use a series of <code>if</code>
		statements to match the various operators) on those two integers to produce the final
		result.  Evaluating a leaf node either looks up the variable in the context or converts
		the constant (if it starts with a digit) to an integer -- use the <code>atoi</code>
		function from the <code>cstdlib</code> header, as done in <code>basic.cc</code> to
		process the line number.
	</p>
	
	
<p>
		At the end of execution, add code to <code>basic.cc</code> which will print out the contents
		of the context, as shown above.  Since an STL map is sorted by key, you will simply need to
		iterate through the map and print out each entry in an appropriate format.
	</p>
