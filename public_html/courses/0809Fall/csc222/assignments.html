<dd>
<p>Programming Project 1: Weiss, Exercise 1.14.</p>
				
<p>Using the <code>Collection</code> class in <a href="libs/pp1"><code>/home/libs/dataStr/pp1/</code></a>
				as a starting point, implement an <code>OrderedCollection</code> class which supports
				the operations <code>isEmpty</code>, <code>makeEmpty</code>, <code>insert</code>,
				<code>remove</code>, <code>findMin</code>, and <code>findMax</code>.  Also write a
				test program which will help confirm that your class works correctly, and which will
				help you determine the running time for each of the operations (which should be noted
				in a comment in the code).</p>
				
<p>It is OK to work singly or in pairs (keep in mind the collaboration advise from the
				<a href="overview.html">syllabus</a>).  When you are finished, put your files in a <code>pp1</code> directory in
				your named directory under <code>/home/libs/dataStr/students/</code>, then
				<a href="mailto:bhoward@depauw.edu">send me an email</a> telling me who worked on the
				project and where it is saved.</p>

<dt>
<a name="pp3"></a>Friday, November 7:</dt>
			
<dd>
<p>Programming Project 3:</p>
				
<p>Write a program which will efficiently perform the following operations (allow the user to choose these from a menu):</p>
				
<ul>
					
<li>Read place information from <code>/home/libs/dataStr/pp3/placese.txt</code> (roughly places east of the Mississippi)</li>
					
<li>Read place information from <code>/home/libs/dataStr/pp3/placesw.txt</code> (roughly places west of the Mississippi)</li>
					
<li>Ask for a place name (for example, "Greencastle") and display information about all the matching places</li>
					
<li>Ask for a number, n, and display the nth largest place from those which have been read in</li>
					
<li>Quit (this one is easy...)</li>
				
</ul>
				
<p>The files of place information, which are based on data from the U.S. Census Bureau, have the following format on each line:</p>
				
<pre>
place name (40 characters wide; may contain spaces)
state abbreviation (2 characters)
population (10 characters, right justified)
degrees latitude (11 characters, prefixed + for North)
degrees longitude (12 characters, prefixed - for West or + for East)
				</pre>
				
<p>For example, <code>placesw.txt</code> starts as follows:</p>
				
<pre>
Adak Station                            AK      4633 +51.842900 -176.640278
Akhiok                                  AK        77 +56.977320 -154.217551
Akiachak                                AK       481 +60.871740 -161.403575
Akiak                                   AK       285 +60.885659 -161.192264
Akutan                                  AK       589 +54.136299 -165.786036
Alakanuk                                AK       544 +62.675611 -164.643602
Alcan                                   AK        27 +62.722977 -141.188178
Aleknagik                               AK       185 +59.285485 -158.628962
Allakaket                               AK       170 +66.545170 -152.733117
Ambler                                  AK       311 +67.076879 -157.918155
Amchitka                                AK        25 +51.567103 +178.877380
				</pre>
				
<p>If the user chooses to read both files of place information, then the queries should search the combined list of places.
				We will discuss appropriate data structures and algorithms in class; be prepared to make suggestions.</p>

<p>Programming Project 4: Six Degrees of Separation</p>
				
<p>The input will be a file listing groups of mutual acquaintances (described below).  The output will be the
		    	following pieces of information:</p>
		    	
<ul>
		    		
<li>The "diameter": the greatest distance between two people in the input, in terms of lengths of
		    		chains of acquaintances, followed by an example of a chain of that length;</li>
		    		
<li>The name of the person closest to the "center" of the input, in the sense of having the smallest
		    		average distance to everyone else.</li>
		    	
</ul>
		    	
		    	
<p>The format of the input is that it consists of a series of lines, with at most one name per line.
		    	Blank lines terminate groups of mutual acquaintances.  For example, in the following:</p>
		    	
<pre>
Dave Berque
Doug Harms
Brian Howard
Adebayo Olowoyeye
Khadija Stewart
Scott Thede
Gloria Townsend

Paul Bender
Jon Dellett
Brian Howard
Verne Leininger
John White
Lee Williams

		    	</pre>
		    	
<p>Each of the first seven people knows the other six, and each of the six people in the second group knows
		    	the other five.  The only name in common is Brian Howard (gee, I wonder why that is...), therefore the
		    	output should be something like this:</p>
		    	
<pre>
Diameter: 2
Dave Berque knows Brian Howard
Brian Howard knows Lee Williams

Center: Brian Howard, with average distance 1.0
		    	</pre>
		    	
		    	
<p>The file <a href="libs/pp4/imdb.txt"><code>imdb.txt</code></a> is data derived from <a href="http://www.imdb.com/">IMDB</a>,
		    	so that you can test the "Kevin Bacon" hypothesis.  Note that in this case, "acquainted with" means "appeared
		    	in a movie with"; it may well be that some of these people know each other in other ways, but we don't count
		    	that.  Once you get your program working efficiently, <a href="libs/pp4/imdb2.txt"><code>imdb2.txt</code></a>
		    	is a larger file of movie data.</p>
		    	
		    	
<p>
<a href="libs/pp4/example.cc">Here is a simple program</a> which shows one way to read in the input:</p>
		    	
<pre>
#include &lt;iostream&gt;
#include &lt;fstream&gt;
#include &lt;string&gt;

using namespace std;

int main()
{
    fstream fin("/home/libs/dataStr/pp4/imdb.txt");
    string name;
    int n = 0;
    
    while (getline(fin, name)) {
        if (name == "") {
            cout &lt;&lt; "Found a group of " &lt;&lt; n &lt;&lt; " names" &lt;&lt; endl;
            n = 0;
        } else {
            // Got another name for the current group
            n++;
        }
    }
    
    return 0;
}
		    	</pre>
		    	
<p>You may rely on the last line of the input file being blank.  You may also assume that the
		    	acquaintance graph is connected &mdash; that is, everyone is connected to everyone else by a chain of
		    	finite length.</p>

		    		<li>Write a few paragraphs justifying your choice of data structures and algorithms in the
		    		project.  Argue that you have made efficient choices with respect to the data to be processed.</li>
		    		
		    		<li>Choose one of the following problems from the <a href="http://acm.uva.es/problemset/">University
		    		of Valladolid</a> programming contest archive:
		    			<ul>
		    				<li><a href="http://icpcres.ecs.baylor.edu/onlinejudge/index.php?option=com_onlinejudge&amp;Itemid=8&amp;category=10&amp;page=show_problem&amp;problem=757">816: Abbott's Revenge</a></li>

		    			</ul>
		    		Note that these problems are not all of equal difficulty &#8212; you may want to discuss your solution
		    		ideas with me before making a final choice about which one you are going to work on.  Your task is
		    		to analyze the problem and come up with appropriate data structures and algorithms to solve it.
		    		<em>You do not need to produce finished C++ code to get full credit for this question,</em> a
		    		description in English or pseudocode is sufficient (but I have to be able to understand what you
		    		mean).  For extra credit, complete a C++ solution and get it accepted by the UVa online judge (you
		    		will need to register with the site to do this &#8212; talk to me if you have any questions about this).
		    		</li>
		    	</ol>
		    	
		    	<p>The written parts should be turned in to me, either in my office or by email, by 5 pm on Tuesday,
		    	May 13.  The project should be completed by that time as well &#8212; send me email as usual, telling
		    	me where it is saved.</p>
		    </dd>
		    
		    <dt><a name="final"/>Friday, December 15:</dt>
		    <dd><p>Final Project and Take-Home Exam: For the project, write a Word Ladder program.  Using the file
		    	<code>words.txt</code> (all files are located in <code>/home/libs/dataStr/pp3/</code>), which contains
		    	over 100,000 english words, search for the shortest way to turn one given word into another, by only
		    	changing one letter at a time.  There is a demo version in the file <code>pp3demo</code>; here is an
		    	example of using it:</p>
		    	<pre>
$ ./pp3demo love hate
Found a path of length 3
love
hove
have
hate
		    	</pre>
		    	<p>You are free to decide what the interface should be, although to get full credit there will need to
		    	be a way to specify the starting and ending words without having to recompile the program (that is,
		    	don't compile them in as constant strings).  If you wish, you may (without penalty) restrict the
		    	program to only work on words of a given length &#8212; I have provided files named <code>words04.txt</code>
		    	through <code>words17.txt</code> which only contain the words of length 4 through 17 (although I doubt
		    	there are any interesting word ladders with 17 characters...).  The program should let the user know
		    	how to specify the first and last words (for example, running <code>./pp3demo</code> without any
		    	arguments produces the error message <code>Usage: ./pp3demo first last</code>, which is a common way
		    	for unix command-line programs to behave).</p>
		    	
		    	<p>While the project may be done in groups of two or three (I have changed my mind on this), the rest
		    	of the exam should be completed individually.  There are two parts:</p>
		    	<ol>
		    		<li>Write a few paragraphs justifying your choice of data structures and algorithms in the
		    		project.  Argue that you have made efficient choices with respect to the data to be processed.</li>
		    		
		    		<li>Choose one of the following problems from the <a href="http://acm.uva.es/problemset/">University
		    		of Valladolid</a> programming contest archive:
		    			<ul>
		    				<li><a href="http://acm.uva.es/p/v9/908.html">908: Re-connecting Computer Sites</a></li>
		    				<li><a href="http://acm.uva.es/p/v9/924.html">924: Spreading the News</a></li>

		    			</ul>
