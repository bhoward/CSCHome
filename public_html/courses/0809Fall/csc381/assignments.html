<dd>
<p>Choose an application domain which interests you and about which you have some knowledge.
			Design a database to manage information for some aspect of this domain. Create a class diagram
			and a corresponding SQL specification (that is, a sequence of <code>create table</code> commands)
			for your database. As a minimum, there should be at least four tables in your database, with
			(ideally) no redundant or inadequate relationships (in the terminology of Chapter 3). In addition,
			give at least four examples of useful queries written against your database. Finally, write up your
			design decisions, and discuss at least one example of a view that could be used to provide
			restricted access to your database for some users.</p>
			
<p>For this project, I am not requiring that you actually create the database (for example, in
			Derby) or populate it with data. However, you may find it helpful to do so when testing your
			queries.</p>
</dd>
			
			
<dt>
<a name="hw1112"></a>Wednesday, November 12:</dt>
			
<dd>Following the model of the <a href="http://twiki.csc.depauw.edu/projects/csc381/browser/public/CollegeDB">CollegeDB</a>
			project on the subversion repository (which is based on the DAO code from Chapter 9 of the text, and which implements the
			database example from the midterm exam), write Java code to interface with the database you designed in the previous
			assignment.  Your code should have a clean separation between the client (which may be very simple), the in-memory model, and the
			data access objects used to connect to the back-end database.  Choose at least three of your database tables to implement (perhaps
			in simplified form, in case your design had lots of tables), and make sure the code can handle creating the database from scratch
			and populating it with some example data.</dd>
			
			
<dt>
<a name="hw1117"></a>Monday, November 17:</dt>
			
<dd>(To be discussed in class) Chapter 12, Exercises 1, 2, 7, 8, 12, and 13; Chapter 13, Exercises 1 through 8</dd>
			
			
<dt>
<a name="hw1124"></a>Monday, November 24:</dt>
			
<dd>(To be discussed in class) Chapter 14, Exercises 3, 7, 10, 16, 18, 20, 21, 23, 25, 31, and 40</dd>
			
			
<dt>
<a name="hw1210"></a>Wednesday, December 10:</dt>
			
<dd>In class we will be extending <a href="http://twiki.csc.depauw.edu/projects/csc381/browser/public/SimpleDB">SimpleDB</a> with
			a <code>REAL</code> data type.  Prepare for this by reviewing the code for each of the levels we have studied, and determining
			what will need to be added or changed.  You may ignore the parser.</dd>

			<dt><a name="hw0904" />Tuesday, September 4:</dt>
			<dd>Chapter 2, Exercises 1, 2, 3, and 7<br />
				Chapter 3, Exercises 2 and 9
			</dd>
			
			<dt><a name="hw0913" />Thursday, September 13:</dt>
			<dd>Chapter 4, Exercises 1, 4, 8, 9, and 20(a, e, i, m, and q)
			</dd>
			
			<dt><a name="hw0927" />Thursday, September 27:</dt>
			<dd>Chapter 8, Exercise 2 (just do query 4.20q). That is, "Write a (Java) program using Derby that executes the following
			query and prints its output table: retrieve the STUDENT record of the students who never received a grade of A in any
			course they took in their major."  I suggest you start by checking out the "StudentClientDerby" project from 
			<code>http://twiki.csc.depauw.edu/svn/csc381/USERNAME</code> (you should have committed this project to your personal
			subversion branch in class on Thursday, September 20 &#8212; if not, check it out of .../public, then choose "Branch/Tag..."
			from the "Team" menu and move your working copy into your own branch by changing "public" to your USERNAME in the "To:"
			field).  Start the Derby network server, and run the "CreateStudentDB" client.  Then write your program to perform the
			above query based on the "StudentMajor" client in that project (you could just make a copy of StudentMajor.java and work
			from there).  When you are done, make sure to do a "Commit..." from the "Team" menu and it will be saved on the subversion
			repository.
			</dd>
			
			<dt><a name="pp1023" />Tuesday, October 23:</dt>
			<dd>The SimpleDB buffer manager currently uses the na&#239;ve replacement strategy, choosing the first unpinned buffer it finds.
			Also, it does a sequential scan to see whether a block is already located in a buffer.  For this project, you should modify the
			buffer manager (in package <code>simpledb.buffer</code>) to improve on both of these situations.
			<ul>
				<li>Modify <code>BasicBufferMgr</code> to implement the LRU replacement strategy.  Keep a queue of unpinned buffers.  When a
				buffer needs to be replaced, choose the one at the head of the queue.  When a buffer becomes unpinned, add it to the end of
				the queue.</li>
				<li>Also modify <code>BasicBufferMgr</code> to keep a <code>Map&lt;Block, Buffer&gt;</code> of allocated buffers, indexed by
				the block each contains (a buffer is "allocated" if it contains a block, whether it is currently pinned or not).  When a
				request comes to pin a block, use the map to determine whether it is currently in a buffer.  You will need to update this
				map when buffers are replaced.  See the <a href="http://java.sun.com/javase/6/docs/api/java/util/Map.html">Java API documentation on maps</a>
				for details on how to use them.</li>
			</ul>
			When you are finished, be sure to commit your changes back to your branch of the subversion repository.
			</dd>
			
			<dt><a name="hw1106" />Tuesday, November 6:</dt>
			<dd>Chapter 14, Exercises 3, 7, 16, 18, 21, 23, 25, and 31</dd>
			
			<dt><a name="pp1129" />Thursday, <del>November 29</del> <ins>December 6</ins>:</dt>
			<dd>Do Chapter 20, Exercise 5, which requires that you also do Exercises 17.19 and 15.10 (note there is a typo in 17.19: it refers
			to Exercise 15.6 when it should say 15.10).  Be sure to commit your changes (including your test program) back to your branch of the
			subversion repository.</dd>
