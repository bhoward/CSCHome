			<dd>Exam 1 Make-up Project: Write a program which will read an 8-bit
			binary number and print out the ten interpretations from problem 3 of
			the exam.  Here are two examples of running it:
			<pre>
Enter binary (8 bits): 01010001
Unsigned int: 81
Hexadecimal: 51
Octal: 121
Two's complement: 81
Sign magnitude: 81
One's complement: 81
Excess-127: -46
ASCII: Q
Pep/8: CHARO direct
Floating-point: 4.25

Enter binary (8 bits): 10001000
Unsigned int: 136
Hexadecimal: 88
Octal: 210
Two's complement: -120
Sign magnitude: -8
One's complement: -119
Excess-127: 9
ASCII: N/A
Pep/8: SUBX immediate
Floating-point: -0.125
			</pre>
			There is a folder in the public directory of the I: drive for this course
			containing a Windows executable of the demonstration
			version which produced the above output, along with some starter C++ code
			which you may use.  The grade for this project will be 10% for each correct
			interpretation, applied as a replacement for whatever grade you received on
			the exam (that is, if you correctly do 7 of the interpretations, I will give
			you 70% on the exam, if that is larger than your actual score).  You may
			talk to other people about this project, but all code you submit must be
			your own (other than my starter code).

			<dd>Programming Project: Write <strong>and test</strong> a program in Pep/8
			assembly language to do the following:
			<ul>
				<li>Read a list of at most 100 positive numbers from the input, terminated
					with 0 if there are fewer than 100;</li>
				<li>Sort the numbers;</li>
				<li>Print the sorted list of numbers on the output.</li>
			</ul>
			To get a score of 80 points out of 100, your program must have the above behavior.
			To qualify for an additional 10 points each, your program should do the following:
			<ul>
				<li>The main program should be structured as a series of calls to subprograms:
					read an array of numbers, sort an array, print an array;</li>
				<li>The sorting algorithm should be O(N log N) instead of O(N^2) &mdash; I suggest
					Quicksort. Here is one version in C++: <pre>
      void swap(int &amp;a, int &amp;b)
      {
          int temp = a;
          a = b;
          b = temp;
      }

      int partition(int a[], int left, int right)
      {
          int pivot = a[left];
          int i = left;

          for (int j = left + 1; j &lt;= right; j++) {
              if (a[j] &lt; pivot) {
                  i++;
                  swap(a[j], a[i]);
              }
          }

          swap(a[left], a[i]);
          return i;
      }

      // Sort array elements a[left] through a[right], inclusive.
      void quicksort(int a[], int left, int right)
      {
          if (right &lt;= left) return;
          int i = partition(a, left, right);
          quicksort(a, left, i - 1);
          quicksort(a, i + 1, right);
      }</pre></li>
      		</ul>
      		I strongly recommend that you write the program in C++ first, then translate your
      		working (i.e., tested and debugged) C++ program into Pep/8 assembly language, and then
      		test it again on the Pep/8 simulator.  Your testing should be thorough enough to
      		convince yourself that the translation has been done correctly and that the program
      		has no bugs.  You may work on this project in pairs; make sure that your name(s) are
      		given in comments at the top of the source code.  When you are finished, either email
      		the Pep/8 source code file to me, or put it in your folder on the I: drive and email
      		me the directory and file name.

			<dd><strong>Because of the timing of this assignment and the final, I am making it optional.  If you
			    would like to complete it and submit it for grading, I will consider it as extra credit (but note
			    that I tend not to give much partial credit on extra credit problems, so please don't submit unless
			    you have complete solutions).</strong><br/>
			    As practice for the exam, do Chapter 11, Exercises 8(b, c, e, and h) and 11.<br/>
			    As a further exercise, do Chapter 11, Exercise 16(a), <b>except</b> have 8 states (000 through 111)
			    instead of 4, and build the circuit in Logisim.  Incorporate the 7-segment decoder from class in the
			    circuit so it will display numbers from 0 to 7 when counting.  Save the <code>.circ</code> file in
			    your folder on the <code>I:</code> drive and email me the file name (or just attach the file).</dd>

			<dd>Programming Project: Translate the following C++ program into Pep/8 assembly language
				<b>and test it</b> on the Pep/8 simulator.  Your testing should be thorough enough to
				convince yourself that the translation has been done correctly and that the program
				has no bugs.  The action of the program should be to read a list of integers from
				input, terminated by -9999 (which is not included in the list).  It should then
				print the list in non-decreasing order on the output, then stop.  The only limit
				on the size of the list should be the number of linked-list nodes that can be
				allocated in memory (without running into the stack... &#x8212; for extra credit, calculate
				exactly how large the list can be for your implementation).  Credit will be based on
				both correctness and readability.
