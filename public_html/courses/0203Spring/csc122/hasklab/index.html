<P>
By working through the steps in this handout, you will develop a Haskell
program to draw a picture made up of many overlapping squares of
different sizes and colors.

<P>

<OL>
<LI>The following data type will represent a single square:
<PRE>
data Square = Square Point Int RGB
</PRE>
This says that a <code>Square</code> will be specified by a <code>Point</code> (the
center), an <code>Int</code> (the distance from the center to any of the
sides, <SPAN  CLASS="textit">i.e.</SPAN>, half the length of a side), and a color expressed
as red, green, and blue components. The type <code>Int</code> is one of the
built-in types (it is a variant of <code>Integer</code> that gives up the very
large values in exchange for greater efficiency); each of the other
types is already defined in the Graphics Library, so we just need to
know how to use them.

<P>
Copy the Haskell script file named <code>hasklab.hs</code> from the folder
<code>I:\CSC122\Public\</code> into your own directory on the <code>I:</code> drive.
Now start WinHugs and <code>:load</code> your copy of the script.  Once it has
loaded (it may take a while, since it has to load all of the parts of
the graphics library as well), you should open it in an editor with the
command <code>:edit</code>.  From now on, each time you close the editor and
return to Hugs, it should automatically load the new version of your
file.

<P>
When you look at the script, it should start with the following lines:
<PRE>
-- CSC122, Haskell Lab
-- &lt;your name&gt;
-- &lt;the date&gt;

import SOEGraphics

data Square = Square Point Int RGB
</PRE>
Change the comments to include your name and the date, save the file,
and close the editor.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>For this item, all we will do is construct a <code>Square</code> object.
To use the <code>Square</code> constructor function, we need a <code>Point</code>,
an <code>Int</code>, and an <code>RGB</code>. A <code>Point</code> is simply a pair of
integers, so we can use something like <code>(200, 100)</code>. An <code>Int</code>
is just a value like <code>50</code>. An <code>RGB</code> needs three integers in
the range 0 to 255; to get white, we can use the <code>RGB</code> constructor
as follows: <code>RGB 255 255 255</code>. Putting all this together, we can
form a white square, 100 units on each side, centered on the point
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">(200, 100)</SPAN>, by using the expression
<code>Square (200, 100) 50 (RGB 255 255 255)</code>. If you type this in, the
system will complain that it cannot find an appropriate ``show''
function. This is OK; we can still use the <code>Square</code> type in a
program, and we can check that we are using it correctly by only
requesting the type of the above expression:
<code>:type Square (200, 100) 50 (RGB 255 255 255)</code>.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>We will need a function to draw one of our <code>Square</code> objects.
The Haskell Graphics library provides a function <code>polygon</code> which
takes a list of <code>Point</code>s and produces a filled-in shape with the
given points as vertices. The script already contains a convenience
function named <code>fillSquare</code> which takes a <code>Square</code> and makes
the appropriate call to <code>polygon</code>:
<PRE>
fillSquare (Square (x,y) d rgb) = withRGB rgb (polygon [(x-d,y-d),
                                                        (x-d,y+d),
                                                        (x+d,y+d),
                                                        (x+d,y-d)])
</PRE>
As usual, we write the function to match its argument against a pattern
so that the variables in the pattern will be bound to the corresponding
values for the <code>Square</code> we wish to draw. The center point will be
<code>(x,y)</code>, the distance from the center to each side will be
<code>d</code>, and the color will be <code>rgb</code>. We call the <code>polygon</code>
function with an appropriate list of points for the four corners of the
square, and pass the result to the <code>withRGB</code> function to apply a
color to the shape. If you try to apply <code>fillSquare</code> to the square
mentioned previously,
<code>fillSquare (Square (200,100) 50 (RGB 255 255 255))</code>, the system
should again complain about the lack of an appropriate ``show''
function. The result is of the type <code>Draw ()</code>, which the system
might also call <code>Graphic</code>. The square has not been drawn yet, but
this <code>Graphic</code> value packages up all the information that the
Graphics Library will need to display it. The next step will do so.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>To display a square on the screen, we need to use the function
<code>showGraphic</code>, which is already defined in your script.  For
reference, here is the definition:
<PRE>
showGraphic g = runGraphics $ do {
    w &lt;- openWindow "Graphics Window" (400,300);
    drawInWindow w g;
    getKey w;
    closeWindow w
}
</PRE>
Try applying <code>showGraphic</code> to the result of various calls to
<code>fillSquare</code>. Each time you do, it should create a graphics window,
display a filled square, and wait for you to hit any key before closing
the window. For testing, it will be convenient to define some sample
squares. Add some more lines like the following to your script and reload:
<PRE>
redGiant = Square (150,150) 100 (RGB 255 0 0)
whiteDwarf = Square (250,250) 25 (RGB 255 255 255)
</PRE>
Now you can easily try drawing squares by entering
<code>showGraphic (fillSquare redGiant)</code>, etc., at the <code>Main&gt; </code>
prompt in Hugs. However, this only lets you draw one square at a time.
To combine several squares in one picture, we need the
<code>overGraphic</code> function. It will be easiest to use this as a binary
operator, as follows:
<code>showGraphic ((fillSquare redGiant) `overGraphic` (fillSquare whiteDwarf))</code>.
Notice how the squares are combined, and see what happens if you reverse the
order of the squares.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Now let's do a list of <code>Square</code>s. We will need a function
which takes a list of squares, fills each one, and combines them all
into a single <code>Graphic</code>. As usual when working with a list of
things, we will define the function by recursion. Here is the base case,
which uses the special value <code>emptyGraphic</code> to produce a blank
picture:
<PRE>
fillSquareList [] = emptyGraphic
</PRE>
The recursive case will have the following form:
<PRE>
fillSquareList (s : ss) =
</PRE>
When this pattern matches, <code>s</code> will be the first square on the
list, and <code>ss</code> will be a list of the remaining squares. Write an
appropriate right-hand side for this case of the function. You will need
to use <code>fillSquare</code> to produce a <code>Graphic</code> from <code>s</code>, and
<code>fillSquareList</code> to produce another <code>Graphic</code> from <code>ss</code>;
then these two <code>Graphic</code>s will need to be combined into one with
<code>overGraphic</code>. When you have added the function to your script, try
it out with <code>showGraphic (fillSquareList [redGiant, whiteDwarf])</code>.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>We will also want a function to <SPAN  CLASS="textit">generate</SPAN> a list of squares,
so that we don't have to type them all in by hand. Here is an example,
which has already been entered in your script file:
<PRE>
diagonalSquares (x,y) d rgb 0 = []
diagonalSquares (x,y) d rgb n = Square (x,y) d rgb :
                                diagonalSquares (x+d,y+d) d rgb (n-1)
</PRE>
Try this:
<code>showGraphic (fillSquareList (diagonalSquares (50,50) 25 (RGB 255 255 255) 9))</code>.
The cases for this function mean that <code>diagonalSquares (x,y) d rgb n</code>
will produce a list of <code>n</code> squares (because the list is empty
when <code>n</code> is <code>0</code>, and it gets one extra element for each
recursive call as <code>n</code> counts down to <code>0</code>). The first one will
be centered at <code>(x,y)</code>, with dimension <code>d</code> and color
<code>rgb</code>. Succeeding squares will be offset by adding <code>d</code> to the
<code>x</code> and <code>y</code> coordinates of the center; the effect will be that
each square will be centered on the lower-right corner of the previous
one. You should get a picture that looks like a white staircase.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>A simple modification to the previous code gives us a row of
squares of different sizes. Create a new function named
<code>vanishingSquares</code> which is similar to <code>diagonalSquares</code>
except replace the argument <code>d</code> in the recursive call (to
<code>vanishingSquares</code>, of course) with the expression <code>(d `quot` 2)</code>.
To try this out, you will probably want to start with a larger
initial square; something like this should work:
<code>showGraphic (fillSquareList (vanishingSquares (200,100) 80 (RGB 255 255 255) 7))</code>

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Now we can approach our original goal of creating an interesting
picture by replacing the single recursive call in the previous item with
four separate calls, one at each of the four corners of the central
square. Each of these recursive calls will produce a list of squares, so
we will need to append all of the lists together, using <code>++</code>. Here
is a skeleton of the code for you to fill in:
<PRE>
squareDesign (x,y) d rgb 0 =
squareDesign (x,y) d rgb n = Square (x,y) d rgb :
                             (squareDesign (x-d,y-d) (d `quot` 2) rgb (n-1) ++
                              squareDesign (x-d,y+d) (d `quot` 2) rgb (n-1) ++
                              squareDesign                                  ++
                              squareDesign                                 )
</PRE>
When you have the finished function saved in your script file, load it
into Hugs and try the following:
<code>showGraphic (fillSquareList (squareDesign (200,150) 70 (RGB 255 255 255) 5))</code>
<BR>
You can change the <code>5</code> to <code>6</code> to draw one more level, but it
will probably crash if you try to do 7 or more levels (each level has
four times as many squares, so there are 4096 squares at level 7).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The last step will be to change the color as well as the size.
Modify the recursive calls so that the upper-left and lower-right
corners have only half the red component of the current square, while
the upper-right and lower-left corners have only half the green
component; leave the blue component untouched. You will need to
pattern-match on the color argument to extract the red, green, and blue
components; that is, you will have something like <code>(RGB r g b)</code>
instead of the simple variable <code>rgb</code>. Call the new function
<code>colorDesign</code>.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>As a final problem, how could you change the code to draw the
larger squares on the bottom, instead of on top? Whichever function
needs to be modified, name the new version by appending a <code>2</code>; for
example, if you modify <code>colorDesign</code>, then your new function should
be named <code>colorDesign2</code>.

<P>
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
When you are done, make sure your script file with all of the above code
is saved in your folder on the <code>I:</code> drive.
