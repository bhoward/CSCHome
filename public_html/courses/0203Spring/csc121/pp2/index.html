<P>
This assignment is due by the start of class on Friday, February 14. You
are encouraged to do this homework with your partner, and you are
welcome to get help on it during the lab time Tuesday.

<P>
Submit a printout of your solution to the problem below. Make sure that
your name and account name are in comments at the top; for example,
<PRE>
/* Description: Programming Homework 2
   Filename:    program1.cpp
   Account:     CSC121xx
   Author:      Your Name
   Date:        Today's Date
*/
</PRE>
If you work with your partner, you only need to submit one copy of the
program; be sure that both of your names are listed in the comments (the
account name should be the one in which the solution is stored).

<P>
You should start by copying the folder called <code>Program2</code> from my
public directory, <code>I:\CSC121\public\Howard\</code>, into your own folder,
<code>I:\CSC121\CSC121xx\</code>.  When you open your copy of the project, by
following the same instructions as for the labs, you should see the
comments shown above; modify them as needed and continue writing your
program.

<P>
Starting with this assignment, you will be graded on program style as well
as correct output.  Style points include proper use of functions to
break up your code, indentation of function and loop bodies to make the
structure of your code easy to read, and the inclusion of comments to
identify the parts of the program and to state the required pre- and
post-conditions for each function other than <code>main</code>.  A program
without all of these style points will not receive full credit.

<P>
The assignment is to produce a program that requests two numbers, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>a</I></SPAN>
and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>b</I></SPAN>, and shows two ways of counting up to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>a</I>&#215;<I>b</I></SPAN>: first
counting by <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>a</I></SPAN>'s, and then counting by <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>b</I></SPAN>'s.  For example, if the user
enters the numbers 3 and 5, then the program should first clear the
screen and display the following on the console:
<PRE>
Counting by 3 to 15:
3
6
9
12
15
Hit &lt;Enter&gt; to continue
</PRE>
After the user hits enter, it should clear the screen and display the
following:
<PRE>
Counting by 5 to 15:
5
10
15
Hit &lt;Enter&gt; to continue
</PRE>
Finally, it should display a farewell message and wait for the user to
hit enter to quit.

<P>
Your program should consist of the following four functions:

<UL>
<LI><code>introduction</code> should print a welcome screen with instructions;
</LI>
<LI><code>displayCount</code> should take two arguments, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>c</I></SPAN> and <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>; it should
clear the screen and then display a count up to <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN>, counting by <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>c</I></SPAN>'s
(for example, the first display above would be produced by a call to
<code>displayCount(3, 15)</code>);
</LI>
<LI><code>farewell</code> should print the farewell message;
</LI>
<LI><code>main</code> should call <code>introduction</code>, then prompt the user
for two numbers, read them in, and make two successive calls to
<code>displayCount</code>, and finally call <code>farewell</code>.
</LI>
</UL>
