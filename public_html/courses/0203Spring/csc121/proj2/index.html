Overview:</A>
</H3>
In preparation for the opening of the new Julian Science Building, we
need to determine how many copiers to locate in the new building. As a
starting point for making this decision, the University would like to
evaluate the use of the copiers in Prevo Library and on second floor of
Julian. You have been hired as a consultant to write a computer
simulation of the waiting lines for these copy machines by using some
data that the Julian staff has projected from direct observation of the
two copiers.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00000300000000000000">
These are the observed data:</A>
</H3>

<OL>
<LI>Every minute 0, 1 or 2 people wish to use the copy machines in
Julian Center.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Each of these 0, 1 or 2 people will choose the Prevo copier 40%
of the time and the second floor copier 60% of the time.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The copying jobs that each of these people have will take 1, 2, 3
or 4 minutes to complete.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>At most ten people will wait in line to use each of these copiers.
If a person approaches either of these lines and sees ten people waiting
in line (which means one person is using the copier and ten are in
line), she will leave the building; she will not walk to the other
machine to investigate its waiting line.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00000400000000000000">
These are specifications that DePauw has requested your
program to meet:</A>
</H3>

<OL>
<LI>The program should simulate a typical 16-hour, 960-minute weekday
at Julian. 

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Although the current data indicate that 0..2 people will wish to
use one of the two copiers every minute, these values may change in the
future. Accordingly, the program should allow 0..MaxPeople people to
wish to use the copier every minute. When the program runs, the user
should be asked to enter the maximum number of people who wish to use
the copier every minute.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Likewise, the current data indicate that 1..4 minutes are needed
for these people to complete their copying jobs. These values could also
change in the future. Accordingly, the program should allow
1..MaxMinutes for the timing of each job. When the program runs, the
user should be asked to enter the maximum number of minutes a copying
job takes.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The current data also indicate that each person prefers the Prevo
copier 40% of the time and the second floor copier 60% of the time.
These preferences could change-especially if the second floor copier
always appears to have a long waiting line. Accordingly, allow the user
to input the preference percent for the Prevo copier only. It is then
assumed that the person prefers the Julian second floor copier
<!-- MATH

</LI>
</OL>

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00000500000000000000">
The output should include:</A>
</H3>

<OL>
<LI>The number of people who wish to use the copy machines during the
course of the simulation (note that you do not need to implement the
queues in order to compute this statistic).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The number of people who arrived and got into each line (Two
separate answers).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The number of people who arrived but left Julian, because there
was no room to wait in their line of choice (Two separate answers).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The average number of people waiting in each line at the end of
each minute (Two separate answers).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The average waiting time for each line (Two separate answers).

<P>
</LI>
<LI>The number of minutes of the day during which there were no people
in line, the number of minutes with one person, number of minutes with
two people, with three people, all the way up to the number of minutes
with ten people in line. This amounts to a frequency distribution of the
length of the queue of people waiting to use a copier at the end of each
minute. You will need to display this output twice, once for each queue
(Twenty-two separate answers).
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
To compute results for parts 4, 5 and 6 the copier has to be a separate
variable from the queue. That is, each person in the queue is waiting to
use the copier. If the copier is not occupied by anyone, the person at
the front of the queue is dequeued and uses the copier; otherwise, the
person at the front of the queue waits. 

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00000600000000000000">
NOTE:</A>
</H3> You do not have to display graphical output
showing items getting entering and leaving the queue as was done in labs
6 and 7. Simply gather input from the user, run the simulation (no
output needs to be displayed while the simulation is running), and
display the statistics described above.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00000700000000000000">
Notes on Style and Suggestions for Getting Started:</A>
</H3>

<P>
The program should exhibit good style, using functions to separate the
problem into small, manageable units (this includes the main body of the
program, which should be at most a screenful or so long). It should be
well-commented (including pre and post conditions for each subprogram)
and easy to read. 

<P>
We strongly suggest doing this program in stages. Begin by getting the
crux of the simulation running and compute only statistic 1) above. Once
you have tested your program--and believe it is working--then add the
remaining statistics one at a time. The goal should be to write the
program incrementally. At all times you should have a working version of
the program that you can turn in. Thus, if you don't complete all of the
statistics, you can still turn in a working program that demonstrates
what you have done. This will probably be much more impressive than
turning in a program that attempts to compute all the statistics but
does not work at all.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00000800000000000000">
STAGE ONE:</A>
</H3> For stage one of this project you are to
turn in a printout of a program which welcomes the user to the program
and then gets (and error checks) all three of the required inputs from
the user doing all appropriate error checking. The program should then
carry out a simplified version of the simulation that only computes the
data for the first of the required outputs. Note that in order to
compute this value you do not need to use queues (the queues will be
used in later stages of the project). Finally, you should print the
results of statistic 1. Note that you are required to read in and error
check all three user inputs even though they are not all required to
compute the data needed for stage one.

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION00000900000000000000">
CONTINUING THE PROJECT:</A>
</H3> Once state one is completed
you can begin to compute the remaining statistics one at a time always
being certain that one statistic is working before moving on to the next
one. Note that in order to compute statistic #2 you will need to expand
your simulation function so that it uses the queues as part of the
simulation. Your simulation function might look something like this:
<PRE>
time = 0;
while (......)
{
  handleArrivals (parameters go here);
  moveFromLineToCopier (parameters go here);
  moveFromLineToCopier (parameters go here);
  letCopyJobFinish (parameters go here);
  letCopyJobFinish (parameters go here);
  moveFromLineToCopier (parameters go here);
  moveFromLineToCopier (parameters go here);
  time++;
}
</PRE>
For the remaining statistics (after #2) you will be making relatively
small changes to the program at each step. 

<P>

<H3><A NAME="SECTION000001000000000000000">
Extra Challenge (Not required for an 'A'):</A>
</H3> The
simulation is currently governed by the rule, ``A person leaves Julian,
if his (her) copier of choice has a waiting line of ten people.'' It
would be interesting to compare the simulation you will submit (the one
described above) with a second, different simulation. This second
program will be governed by the rule, ``A person first tries his (her)
copier of choice; if the line is too long (ten), then (s)he tries the
second copier.'' How will the statistical results differ? If you try this
option or any others, you should turn in two programs: The original
program, as well the one with this optional feature.
