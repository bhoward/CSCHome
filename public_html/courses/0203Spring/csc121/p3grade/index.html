<P>
Please turn in this sheet stapled to the printout of your program.

<UL>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Style (50 points)</SPAN>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>_____</STRONG> (5 points) Program has appropriate comments at the top
that describe what the program accomplishes, and who wrote it.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>_____</STRONG> (5 points) The comments include the full name of the
folder containing the program (for example,
<code>I:\CSC121\CSC12101\Project3</code>). I need this so that I can easily
find your program on the network drive.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>_____</STRONG> (10 points) All functions have correct pre- and
post-conditions. Points will be subtracted if they are not true or are
incomplete.  Comments should be used at other points in the code to help
explain anything difficult or confusing.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>_____</STRONG> (10 points) The code is neatly and consistently indented,
and blank lines are used to separate function definitions.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>_____</STRONG> (10 points) All variable, constant, and function names
(and any other identifiers) are descriptive and appropriate. It is OK to
use <code>x</code> for an <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>x</I></SPAN>-coordinate or <code>i</code> for a loop index, but in
general a name should be a (meaningful) complete word or phrase.  Named
constants are used instead of numeric values.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>_____</STRONG> (10 points) Each function does one unique task and no
function is inappropriately long. A rule of thumb is that the entire
function should fit on the screen when editing it.  If a section of code
is repeated several times, perhaps with slight variations, then it
should probably be split off into a separate function (with parameters
to exchange the required information).
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Program Operation (50 points)</SPAN>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>_____</STRONG> (3 points) The class must contain at least three data
elements in the private section.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>_____</STRONG> (5 points) The constructor and init functions are correct.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>_____</STRONG> (4 points) The readFile function is correct.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>_____</STRONG> (4 points) The writeFile function is correct.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>_____</STRONG> (4 points) The display function is correct.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>_____</STRONG> (30 points) The main program provides a menu of operations,
and each of the six operations (load, display, save, add, sort, and
quit) should work correctly (5 points per operation).
</DD>
</DL>

<P>
</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Late Penalty</SPAN>
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>_____</STRONG> As described in the syllabus, ``Late submissions will be
accepted until the next class time at a penalty of half the grade.
Extensions will be considered <SPAN  CLASS="textit">only</SPAN> by prior arrangement.''
Submission time will be determined by the last modification time on the
source file in the <code>I:</code> drive, so be sure not to edit the project
after it has been submitted.
