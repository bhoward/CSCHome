<dt>Course Description:</dt>
			
<dd>
				
<p>
					This course builds on CSC 121 and introduces programming
					topics such as sets, recursion and dynamic data types. Data
					type abstraction and implementation are introduced by
					studying structures, such as lists, stacks, queues and
					binary trees. The object-oriented implementation of these
					structures is emphasized. Tools for algorithm analysis are
					introduced, and comparisons of functional, object oriented
					and imperative programming paradigms are made. The concept
					of tradeoffs (i.e., time vs. space, iteration vs. recursion,
					static vs. dynamic and imperative vs. functional) recurs as
					a theme throughout the course. This course will be taught in
					Java, and will follow up on the Java topics covered in CS 1.
				</p>

				
<p>
					This course can be considered as being composed two sets of
					overlapping and complementary ideas: the art and science of
					program design and implementation, and the fundamentals of
					computer science. The program design and implementation
					component will entail completing several programming
					assignments during the semester. These assignments, taken as
					a whole, will be larger in scope than the projects you
					completed in the first Computer Science course, and they
					will be tied directly to ideas studied in the fundamental
					concepts component of the course. A large part of the
					outside work associated with the course will involve
					assignments designed to enhance lecture concepts.
				</p>
			
</dd>

			
<dt>Grading:</dt>
			
<dd>
				The grade for this course will be based on the following:
				<ul>
					
<li>35%: Programming projects</li>
					
<li>15%: Homework assignments and quizzes</li>
					
<li>
						30%: Midterm exams (Wednesday, September 27 and Wednesday,
						November <del>8</del> <ins>15</ins>)
					</li>
					
<li>
						20%: Final exam: Monday, December 11, 8:30-11:30 am
					</li>
				
</ul>
				The grading scale used for this class will be the following: A
				(93-100), A- (90-92), B+ (87-89), B (83-86), B- (80-82), C+
				(77-79), C (73-76), C- (70-72), D+ (67-69), D (63-66), D-
				(60-62), F(0-59). I reserve the right to alter this grading
				scale at any time. The last day to withdraw from class is
				Friday, October 13<sup>th</sup>.

<dt>Policy Statements:</dt>
			
<dd>
				
<ul>
					
<li>
						You are expected to attend all class sessions. However,
						I expect you to take your own education seriously, so I
						do not keep formal attendance records. If you miss a
						class, you are responsible for catching up with the
						material that was covered and any announcements that
						were made.
					</li>
					
<li>
						Homework assignments are due at the start of class and
						programming projects are due by 5 pm on the assigned
						date. Late submissions will be accepted until the next
						class time at a penalty of half the grade. Extensions
						will be considered
						<em>only</em>
						by prior arrangement.
					</li>
					
<li>
						Programming projects will be graded on style and
						efficiency as well as correct operation. To develop as a
						programmer, you are strongly encouraged to do more than
						the minimum assigned amount of work; the best way to
						learn good style and common idioms is to read and write
						lots of code.
					</li>
					
<li>
						Cheating, plagiarism, submission of the work of others,
						etc., violates the DePauw policy on academic integrity
						and may result in penalties ranging from a lowered grade
						to course failure or expulsion. The policy and
						discussion of each student's obligations and rights are
						in the Student Handbook.
					</li>
					
<li>
						With respect to this course, no collaboration is
						permitted on exams or quizzes. You may discuss homework
						problems and programming assignments with anyone you
						want (in fact, you are encouraged to do so), but you
						should not copy another student's work nor permit your
						work to be copied. The key idea is that you should
						<em>understand</em>
						all of the work you turn in, and you should be able to
						replicate it on your own. If you do not feel that you
						can replicate the work independently, then it is not
						fair (to yourself or to others) to submit it as your own
						work. If at any time you are uncertain what constitutes
						"appropriate" collaboration, it is your responsibility
						to clarify it with me.
					</li>
					
<li>
						Exams in this course will be closed-book and
						closed-notes, and will cover lectures and assigned
						readings. More information will be available prior to
						each exam.
					</li>
					
<li>
						During class time, the computer at your seat should be
						used for note-taking, classroom interaction, and
						in-class exercises. You are not permitted to read
						e-mail, browse the web, play games, etc. while class is
						in session.
					</li>
					
<li>
						This class will be using the Java programming language.
						You may use your choice of IDEs, but the preferred
						choices will be either <a href="http://www.bluej.org/">BlueJ</a>
						or <a href="http://www.eclipse.org/">Eclipse</a>. Assignments
						will be accepted in either format. If you want to use some other
						environment, talk to me about it (before the assignment
						is due!).
					</li>
					
<li>
						Regrade requests will be entertained for up to one week
						after the assignment or exam is returned to the student.
						To request a regrade, please write out on a separate
						sheet of paper your request and attach it to the
						assignment or exam, and give it to me. A simple request
						for more points without a justification is not
						sufficient! Keep in mind that the entire assignment or
						exam may be regraded, so carefully consider your
						requests!
					</li>
					
<li>
						Please feel free to offer me feedback (positive and
						negative) about my performance or anything else related
						to the class. This feedback will have no effect on your
						grade in the class.
					</li>
					
<li>
						Reading assignments will be given in class. They will
						mostly consist of readings from the class textbook, but
						other handouts and papers may be assigned as well.
					</li>
					
<li>
						All information about the class, whether given in this
						handout or in class, is subject to change.
					</li>
