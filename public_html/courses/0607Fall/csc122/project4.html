<h1>
	CSC 122: Computer Science II, Fall 2006</h1>
	
<h2>Project 4</h2>
	
		
<h3>Rumpelstiltskin</h3>
		
<h3>Deadline: Friday, December 8, 5:00 p.m.</h3>

		
<dl>
			
<dt>Overview:</dt>
			
<dd>
			
<p>In the classic fairy tale "Rumpelstiltskin", a magical creature threatens
			to take a woman's baby unless she can guess the creature's name.  She guesses
			names unsuccessfully for a while, then overhears that its name is Rumpelstiltskin
			and wins the challenge (I always considered this a bit of a cheat, and wondered
			just what the moral of the story was supposed to be, but that's beside the point...).</p>
			
			
<p>In this assignment, you will implement a program to play a name guessing
			game.  To help the computer guess a name, after each incorrect guess you will
			tell it whether the desired name comes before or after the guess in dictionary
			order.  When the program starts, the user can load in a list of common names from a file
			and store them in a binary search tree.  Playing a game is then just following the
			process of searching the tree, with the twist that it asks the user which way to go
			from each node.  If it finds the player's name in the tree, then the computer wins.
			If it reaches a point where there are no more possible names, then it gives up --
			the user is then asked what name they were thinking of, and it is inserted at the
			correct position in the tree.  In either case, the computer offers to play another
			round.  At the end, the user is given the chance to save the names (including new
			ones learned while playing) to a file before exiting.</p>

<dt>Specification:</dt>
	
<dd> 
	  
<p>
<b>The Guessing project</b> has at least four classes:</p>
	  
<ol>
	    
<li>
<b>Driver:</b> Contains the method <b>main</b>, which creates an instance 
	      of <b>GuessingGUI</b> and invokes its <b>start</b> method. <b>Driver</b> 
	      will be used to run the application stand-alone (not in the BlueJ environment) 
	      once you have completed the rest of the project. You should test as you 
	      go by using instances of <b>GuessingGUI</b>, <b>Game</b> and the other classes 
	      you write.</li>
	    
<li>
<b>GuessingGUI:</b> Contains code that creates a Graphical User Interface 
	      with components that are used to accomplish interaction with the application (see 
	      below). You should not have to modify this class, but it is worth looking through
	      the code to see how the methods in your <b>Game</b> class will interact with the GUI.
	      It also contains the methods 
	      used by <b>Game</b> to communicate with the player and to open files for reading and for writing.</li>
	    
<li>
<b>Game:</b> Contains a skeleton of code with TODO comments indicating what needs to be filled in.</li>
	    
<li>The fourth class will be some form of binary search tree, used by the game to hold the
	    collection of known names.  You may base this on the <b>BST</b> class discussed in class, or
	    the version presented in the textbook; however, you will need to figure out how to adapt these
	    classes to play the name guessing game (where the interaction with the user determines the
	    search path through the tree).</li>
	    
<li>
<b>You may choose to write or include additional classes or methods; a 
	      TreeNode class, for example.</b> For each such class and method make sure 
	      to provide complete documentation using JavaDoc format.</li>
	  
</ol>
	
</dd>
	
<dt>The Project and Getting Started:</dt>
	
<dd> 
	  
<p>
<strong>The Guessing project:</strong>
</p>
	  
<ul>
	    
<li>The provided files can be copied from <code>I:\10607_CSC122\public\Rumpelstiltskin</code>.  In
	    addition to the Java files for the project skeleton described above, you will find a text file named
	    <code>2Knames.txt</code> which has the 2000 most popular baby names from 2005, according to the
	    U.S. Social Security Administration
	    (<a href="http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/"><code>http://www.ssa.gov/OACT/babynames/</code></a>);
	    the names are arranged one per line, in order from most to least popular, so they are ready to
	    be loaded in when playing the game.</li>
	    
<li>Implement the project using the test-driven implementation strategy: first 
	      build a test system and stubbed implementation of each class.</li>
	    
<li>When you write out the contents of the tree, you should perform a preorder traversal.  This will
	    allow the same tree structure to be created when the file is read back in.  For each name traversed,
	    write it to the file with the method call <code>writer.println(name);</code> (that is, you may use
	    a <b>PrintWriter</b> object in the same way you use <code>System.out</code>).</li>
	    
<li>There is a demonstration version of the program in the <code>public</code> folder, named
	    <code>RumpelstiltskinDemo.jar</code> -- it is an executable jar file which should run when double-clicked,
	    if Java is installed correctly.</li>
	  
</ul>
	  
<p>
<strong>Standards:</strong>
</p>
	  
<p>Your project should be well-written, neatly-formatted, modular, and
	  well-documented.</p>
	  
<p>
<strong>Grading:</strong>
</p>
	  
<ul>
	    
<li>Correctly handling binary search tree operations (60 points) 
	      <ul>
	        
<li>write the tree to a file</li>
	        
<li>insert a name</li>
	        
<li>play the (binary-search-like) name guessing game</li>
	      
</ul>
	    
</li>
	    
<li>Correctly filling in the skeleton of the <b>Game</b> class. (20 points) </li>
	    
<li>Documentation and style (20 points)</li>
	  
</ul>
