cp /home/libs/dataStr/pp2/* pp2

<p>Final Project and Take-Home Exam: For the project, write a Word Ladder program.  Using the file
		    	<code>words.txt</code> (all files are located in <code>/home/libs/dataStr/pp3/</code>), which contains
		    	over 100,000 english words, search for the shortest way to turn one given word into another, by only
		    	changing one letter at a time.  There is a demo version in the file <code>pp3demo</code>; here is an
		    	example of using it:</p>
		    	
<pre>
$ ./pp3demo love hate
Found a path of length 3
love
hove
have
hate
		    	</pre>
		    	
<p>You are free to decide what the interface should be, although to get full credit there will need to
		    	be a way to specify the starting and ending words without having to recompile the program (that is,
		    	don't compile them in as constant strings).  If you wish, you may (without penalty) restrict the
		    	program to only work on words of a given length -- I have provided files named <code>words04.txt</code>
		    	through <code>words17.txt</code> which only contain the words of length 4 through 17 (although I doubt
		    	there are any interesting word ladders with 17 characters...).  The program should let the user know
		    	how to specify the first and last words (for example, running <code>./pp3demo</code> without any
		    	arguments produces the error message <code>Usage: ./pp3demo first last</code>, which is a common way
		    	for unix command-line programs to behave).</p>
		    	
		    	
<p>While the project may be done in groups of two or three (I have changed my mind on this), the rest
		    	of the exam should be completed individually.  There are two parts:</p>
		    	
<ol>
		    		
<li>Write a few paragraphs justifying your choice of data structures and algorithms in the
		    		project.  Argue that you have made efficient choices with respect to the data to be processed.</li>
		    		
		    		
<li>Choose one of the following problems from the <a href="http://acm.uva.es/problemset/">University
		    		of Valladolid</a> programming contest archive:
		    			<ul>
		    				
<li>
<a href="http://acm.uva.es/p/v9/908.html">908: Re-connecting Computer Sites</a>
</li>
		    				
<li>
<a href="http://acm.uva.es/p/v9/924.html">924: Spreading the News</a>
</li>
		    				
<li>
<a href="http://acm.uva.es/p/v9/925.html">925: No more prerequisites, please!</a>
</li>
		    				
<li>
<a href="http://acm.uva.es/p/v9/977.html">977: Old West Rumours</a>
</li>
		    				
<li>
<a href="http://acm.uva.es/p/v9/988.html">988: Many paths, one destination</a>
</li>
		    			
</ul>
		    		Note that these problems are not all of equal difficulty -- you may want to discuss your solution
		    		ideas with me before making a final choice about which one you are going to work on.  Your task is
		    		to analyze the problem and come up with appropriate data structures and algorithms to solve it.
		    		<em>You do not need to produce finished C++ code to get full credit for this question,</em> a
		    		description in english or pseudocode is sufficient (but I have to be able to understand what you
		    		mean).  For extra credit, complete a C++ solution and get it accepted by the UVa online judge (you
		    		will need to register with the site to do this -- talk to me if you have any questions about this).
		    		</li>
		    	
</ol>
		    	
		    	
<p>The written parts should be turned in to me, either in my office or by email, by noon on Friday,
		    	December 15.  The project should be completed by that time as well -- send me email as usual, telling
		    	me who worked on the code and where it is saved.</p>
