<dt>Course Description:</dt>
			
<dd>
				
<p>
					The goal of the course is to introduce programming to students with no prior programming experience.
					The concepts are motivated by writing programs in Java to manipulate media, producing effects similar
					to those in applications such as Photoshop.  In addition to manipulating digital images and sounds,
					students will explore techniques for creating pictures, music, and simple movies programmatically.
					By relating the concepts to these concrete examples, and seeing the same techniques used for several
					different media types, students will learn how digital media work, as well as the fundamentals of
					computer programming.
				</p>
				
				
<p>
					This will be taught as a W course, with writing assignments on issues of aesthetics and perception
					of digital media, and the role of computers in the creative process.  The first paper will be a research
					paper (roughly 10 pages) on a topic related to human sensory perception and its relation to digitized
					media.  For example, you might investigate how the human visual system influences color systems, how
					the visual or auditory systems determine image resolution or sampling rates, or how compression
					techniques take advantage of the limitations of these systems.  The second paper will be a survey and
					review (roughly 5 pages) of the work of an artist who works with digital media.  The third paper will be
					a description (roughly 5 pages) of an artistic technique which you have explored, accompanied by
					examples of the use of the technique.  One other W component will be keeping a weekly journal of
					reflections on the course: each student will write one or more paragraphs each week about what was
					learned in the class, what went well or didn't go well, and what else would be nice to do.
				</p>
				
				
<p>
					This course is not intended for students who have already taken CSC 121, Computer Science I.  Successful
					completion of this course may take the place of CSC 121 (for major/minor requirements as well as
					for prerequisites) if a student decides to take further courses in Computer Science.
				</p>
			
</dd>

			
<dt>Grading:</dt>
			
<dd>The grade for this course will be based on the following:
				<ul>
					
<li>
						30%: Quizzes, Homework, and Programming Projects
					</li>
					
<li>
						20%: Writing Assignments (three papers, plus weekly reflection)
					</li>
					
<li>
						30%: In-class exams (Wednesdays, February 27 and April 16)
					</li>
					
<li>
						20%: Final exam (Monday, May 12, 8:30-11:30 am)
					</li>
				
</ul>
				
<p>The grading scale used for this class will be the following: A
				(93-100), A- (90-92), B+ (87-89), B (83-86), B- (80-82), C+
				(77-79), C (73-76), C- (70-72), D+ (67-69), D (63-66), D-
				(60-62), F(0-59). I reserve the right to alter this grading
				scale at any time. The last day to withdraw from class is
				Friday, October 13<sup>th</sup>.</p>

<dt>Policy Statements:</dt>
			
<dd>
				
<ul>
					
<li>
						You are expected to attend all class sessions. However,
						I expect you to take your own education seriously, so I
						do not keep formal attendance records. If you miss a
						class, you are responsible for catching up with the
						material that was covered and any announcements that
						were made.
					</li>
					
<li>
						Homework assignments are due at the start of class and
						programming projects are due by 5 pm on the assigned
						date. Late submissions will be accepted until the next
						class time at a penalty of half the grade. Extensions
						will be considered
						<em>only</em>
						by prior arrangement.
					</li>
					
<li>
						Programming projects will be graded on style and
						efficiency as well as correct operation. To develop as a
						programmer, you are strongly encouraged to do more than
						the minimum assigned amount of work; the best way to
						learn good style and common idioms is to read and write
						lots of code.
					</li>
					
<li>
						Writing assignments will be graded on style as well as
						content.  I will be happy to read early drafts and give
						feedback on content (but <em>not</em> copy-editing).
					</li>
					
<li>
						Cheating, plagiarism, submission of the work of others,
						etc., violates the DePauw policy on academic integrity
						and may result in penalties ranging from a lowered grade
						to course failure or expulsion. The policy and
						discussion of each student's obligations and rights are
						in the Student Handbook.
					</li>
					
<li>
						With respect to this course, no collaboration is
						permitted on exams or quizzes. You may discuss homework
						problems and programming assignments with anyone you
						want (in fact, you are encouraged to do so), but you
						should not copy another student's work nor permit your
						work to be copied. The key idea is that you should
						<em>understand</em>
						all of the work you turn in, and you should be able to
						replicate it on your own. If you do not feel that you
						can replicate the work independently, then it is not
						fair (to yourself or to others) to submit it as your own
						work. If at any time you are uncertain what constitutes
						"appropriate" collaboration, it is your responsibility
						to clarify it with me.
					</li>
					
<li>
						During class time, the computer at your seat should be
						used for note-taking, classroom interaction, and
						in-class exercises. You are not permitted to read
						e-mail, browse the web, play games, etc. while class is
						in session.
					</li>
					
<li>
						Regrade requests will be entertained for up to one week
						after the assignment or exam is returned to the student.
						To request a regrade, please write out on a separate
						sheet of paper your request and attach it to the
						assignment or exam, and give it to me. A simple request
						for more points without a justification is not
						sufficient! Keep in mind that the entire assignment or
						exam may be regraded, so carefully consider your
						requests!
					</li>
					
<li>
						Please feel free to offer me feedback (positive and
						negative) about my performance or anything else related
						to the class. This feedback will have no effect on your
						grade in the class.
					</li>
					
<li>
						Reading assignments will be given in class. They will
						mostly consist of readings from the class textbook, but
						other handouts and papers may be assigned as well.
					</li>
					
<li>
						All information about the class, whether given in this
						handout or in class, is subject to change.
					</li>
