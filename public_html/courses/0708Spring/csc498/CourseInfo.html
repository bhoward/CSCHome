<h3>Course Overview:</h3>


<p>During the first few weeks of the
semester, students will either develop an independent project proposal that
specifies a well-defined project of appropriate rigor and that indicates the
student has the necessary skills and knowledge to implement the project, or
students will write a project proposal chosen from <a href="ProjectIdeas.html">a set of faculty-defined
problems</a> that are based upon concepts from completed Computer Science courses. 
At regular intervals during the remainder of the semester, students will
demonstrate progress toward successful completion of their individual
projects.  As the course satisfies the `S' competency requirement, several
formal presentations will be given, along with informal discussions about
student projects and about ethical issues related to these projects.</p>


<h3>Instructor Role and Independent Work:</h3>


<p>One of the computer science
department's goals for the senior project course is to give each student the
chance to independently carry out all stages of a large project (proposal,
implementation, testing, documentation, and presentation).  In this light, part
of your task is to learn how to work through any obstacles you may encounter.  
</p>


<p>More specifically, we assume
students will implement these projects independently, although you will of
course be able to work with your classmates if one of them has some knowledge
that you need to learn. <b><i>The instructor for this course primarily serves
as a coach and guide.</i></b> Depending on your project topic, the
instructor may or may not be able to refer you to reference materials at
various points during the project, and the instructor may or may not be in a
position to offer technical suggestions.  In some situations your instructor
may direct you to consult with another faculty member, if the project lies
outside of his or her specialty areas and if you have questions about the
design of the project. <b><i>However, debugging, except in rare cases, is not
performed by any of the faculty members.</i></b> All instructors are
asked to record debugging help (and any other consultation meetings) that
seniors request.  If we find that debugging help is necessary, then the Senior
Project goals are compromised, and your final grade may be adjusted (see
grading policies). We will inform you, should concern about this part of your
grade develop.</p>
