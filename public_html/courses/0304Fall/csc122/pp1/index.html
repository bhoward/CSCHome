<P>
Write a program that does the following:

<OL>
<LI>Prompt the user to enter a file name for input.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Open the specified file. If the file doesn't exist, print an error
message and exit the program.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Read in all the words from the input file. You may assume that
there are no more than 250 words in the file.

<P>
You may also assume that a ``word'' is a contiguous group of non-white
space characters. This sounds complicated, but is really not. For
example, in the previous sentence, <code>not.</code> would be a word, as would
<code>"word"</code> in the sentence before that--note the inclusion of the
period and the quotation marks.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Sort the set of words into alphabetical order. Remember that
alphabetical order in C++ means that capital words come first, then
non-capitalized, etc. Keep in mind that you can compare strings using
the same comparison operators (<code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;</code>, etc.) that you use
with numbers.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Prompt the user to enter a file name for output.

<P>
</LI>
<LI>Write the words, in alphabetical order, to the output file.
</LI>
</OL>

<P>
Place the work for this assignment in your personal <code>I:\CSC122</code>
folder in a folder called <code>HW1</code>. See below for how to create a
project from scratch - call the project <code>hw1.ide</code>. Turn in a
printout of this assignment on the due date in class. There is a file
called <code>sample.txt</code> in the <code>public\Thede</code> folder that you can
use to test your program.

<P>
There are a number of topics that will be useful for the assignment:

<UL>
<LI>File I/O--<code>fstream</code> variables, etc.
</LI>
<LI>Strings
</LI>
<LI>Arrays
</LI>
<LI>Sorting--bubble sort is the easiest to code, but you can use any
algorithm you want, as long as it works.
</LI>
</UL>
You may want to brush up on these, either with your CS1 books or
Appendix A in the textbook.

Creating a Borland C++ Project from Scratch</A>
</H2>
From the <code>File</code> menu, choose <code>Project...</code> out of the
<code>New</code> submenu.  The ``New Target'' dialog box will appear.  Enter
the correct project path and name in the first text box; for this
assignment, you would enter <code>I:\CSC122\YourName\HW1\hw1.ide</code>.  Make
sure that ``Application [.exe]'' is selected under ``Target Type,'' and
that the ``Platform'' and ``Target Model'' are ``Win32'' and ``Console''
(it will probably default to ``GUI,'' so you will need to be sure this
gets changed).  Now click the ``Advanced'' button and uncheck the boxes
labeled <code>.rc</code> and <code>.def</code>, then click ``OK'' twice to make each
dialog go away.  Finally, double-click the <code>.cpp</code> node in the
project window that appears and you will get an editor window where you
can start entering your program.

<P>
To attach additional source files to a project, choose
<code>File/New/TextEdit</code> and then <code>File/Save as...</code> from the menu.
Give your file an appropriate name in the ``Save File'' dialog and click
``OK.''  Now, in the project window, right-click on the <code>.exe</code> node
(at the top) and choose ``Add node'' from the context menu.  This will
bring up a file chooser; select the new file you just created and click
``OK.''  The next time you build the project, this new file will be
compiled in with the rest of the program.
