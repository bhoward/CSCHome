Copy the folder <code>I:\CSC122\public\prog4\</code> into your own directory on
the <code>I:</code> drive.  This folder contains several files, including
<code>project.ide</code>, <code>project.cpp</code>, <code>sortlist.h</code>, and
<code>sortlist.cpp</code>.  The file <code>project.cpp</code> does not need to be
changed--it contains a driver program to test the <code>sortlist</code>
class.  Your task for this assignment is to write this class (in the
files <code>sortlist.h</code> and <code>sortlist.cpp</code>) so that the driver
program works correctly.

<P>
It is usually best in programming projects to write things and test them
incrementally, not all at once.  For this assignment, I suggest these
steps to allow you to test incrementally:

<UL>
<LI>First you need to completely write <code>sortlist.h</code>, which
defines the headers for all of the member functions of the class.
</LI>
<LI>Then you should put ``empty'' definitions in <code>sortlist.cpp</code>:
write the headers for the functions with nothing between the braces in
the bodies.  This will allow the program to compile, but none of the
functions will do anything.
</LI>
<LI>Now you can write the member functions one at a time and test
them.
</LI>
</UL>

<P>
Turn in a printout of the files <code>sortlist.h</code> and
<code>sortlist.cpp</code> on the due date in class.  You do not need to print
out <code>project.cpp</code>.  Make sure your name is included in each file
that you print out.
