<H1 ALIGN="CENTER">Programming with HasCl</H1>

<P>
This handout covers the basics of programming in HasCl, which is essentially
a subset of the functional language Haskell.  Although the details are
specific to the Funnie environment, most of it should apply to other Haskell
systems such as Hugs or GHC (see <A HREF="http://www.HasCl.org/">http://www.HasCl.org/</A> for more
details on these and other implementations of the language).
In comparison with other tutorials available on the web, the focus here
will be on learning to work with recursion and some of the elementary
data structures traditionally encountered in Computer Science II; it is
not specifically about exploring the power of Haskell, which has many
advanced features that we will not discuss.

<P>

<H1><A NAME="SECTION00010000000000000000">
Interacting with Funnie</A>
</H1>
When you start a session with Funnie you should see an expression window,
plus a browseable list of pre-defined functions.  This
means that the system is ready to evaluate expressions, calculator-style,
in the context of the standard collection of definitions known as
the prelude.  The prelude defines many powerful operations on numbers,
strings, and lists.  Try entering each of the following expressions at
the prompt, clicking the evaluate button after each, and figure out what the responses mean;
then test yourself by trying similar expressions and guessing what the
responses will be.
<PRE>
1+2*3
1+2^3
(1+2)^3
product([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6])
product([1 .. 6])
sum([1 .. 6]) / length([1 .. 6])
sum([1 .. 6]) # length([1 .. 6])
[1 .. 6] ++ reverse([1 .. 6])
"Hello" ++ "World!"
toUpper('a')
map(toUpper, "Hello!")
map(sqrt, [1 .. 6])
map(odd, [1 .. 6])
head([1 .. 6])
tail([1 .. 6])
(head([1 .. 6]), head("Hello!"))
zip([1 .. 6], "Hello!")
</PRE>

<P>
To use functions beyond those defined in the prelude, you will need to
enter them in a definition window.  From the Window menu, select ``New
Definition Window,'' then click in the window to start typing.  When the
function is complete, click on the compile button; if the definition does
not have any syntax errors, it will be added to the list of locally-defined
functions in the top half of the function browser.  Otherwise, read the
message in the error window and try again.

<P>
For practice, enter the following definition:
<PRE>
fact(0) = 1
fact(n) = n * fact(n-1)
</PRE>

<P>
Once you have successfully entered a definition, it will be available
for use in the expression window just like the functions in the prelude.
With the above function definition, you should now be able to enter an
expression such as <code>fact(5)</code> to compute the factorial of 5 (<SPAN CLASS="MATH">5!</SPAN>).
When you try this, you should also click on the ``Open Stepper'' button
to bring up a stepper window, in which you can trace the individual
evaluation steps.

<P>

Basic Types</A>
</H1>
If you worked through the expressions in the previous section, you
have already encountered most of the standard built-in types of values
available in HasCl.  Now we will look at each in more detail.
<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Num</STRONG></DT>
<DD>HasCl has a very rich collection of numeric values, but as opposed to
many programming languages, it does not have separate types for integers
and floating-point numbers; instead, all numbers belong to the type
<code>Num</code>. Unlike the type <code>int</code> of C++, there is no upper limit
to the size of a <code>Num</code>. For example, we may use the <code>fact</code>
function defined above to find <SPAN CLASS="MATH">52!</SPAN> (which counts the number of ways to
arrange a deck of 52 playing cards):
<PRE>
fact(52) =&gt; 80658175170943878571660636856403766975289505440883277824000000000000
</PRE>
This 68-digit number is a value of type <code>Num</code>.  HasCl will
happily work with numbers having thousands of digits, up to the limits
of your computer's memory.  Arithmetic on large numbers is important in
applications such as cryptography, where schemes such as RSA encryption
are based on the ease of multiplying multi-hundred-digit numbers (and
the corresponding difficulty of factoring the result back into the
original numbers).

<P>
All of the usual arithmetic operations are available on <code>Num</code>s:
<code>+</code>, <code>-</code>, <code>*</code>, and <code>/</code>. In general, division of two
integers will produce a rational number (for example, try
<code>22 / 8</code>). To divide <code>a</code> by <code>b</code> and get an integer result, use the
<code>#</code> operator: <code>a # b</code>. This gives the quotient; to get the
remainder, use <code>a % b</code> (this is the same as in C++).
Exponentiation, which is not a built-in operator in C++, is written with
the caret operator, <code>^</code>; that is, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>a</I><SUP>b</SUP></SPAN> is written <code>a^b</code>.

<P>
We sometimes need to use an operator like a function. By surrounding any
operator in parentheses you can do just that. For example, <code>(+)</code> is
a function which takes two arguments, so <code>(+)(1, 2)</code> is the same as
<code>1 + 2</code>.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Question:</SPAN> Convert the expressions <code>1+2*3</code> and <code>(1+2)*3</code>
into equivalent calls to the functions <code>(+)</code> and <code>(*)</code>.  What can
you discover about the precedence rules for the arithmetic operators in HasCl?

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Bool</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The type <code>Bool</code> represents truth conditions, either
<code>true</code> or <code>false</code>.  It is essentially equivalent to the
<code>bool</code> type of C++.  Comparison operators such as <code>==</code>,
<code>!=</code> (not equal), <code>&lt;</code>, <code>&gt;=</code>, ..., return values of type
<code>Bool</code>.  The standard logical operations are available:
<code>1 &lt; x &amp;&amp; x &lt; 10</code> is true if <code>x</code> is both greater than 1 <SPAN  CLASS="textit">and</SPAN>
less than 10; <code>x == 2 || odd(x)</code> is true if <code>x</code> is either equal to 2
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">or</SPAN> odd; and <code>not(odd(x))</code> is true if <code>x</code> is <SPAN  CLASS="textit">not</SPAN>
odd (this can also be written <code>even(x)</code>).

<P>
Given a boolean value, the natural way to use it is to make a decision
between two choices.  HasCl has a conditional expression similar to
that found in most languages:  if <code>b</code> has type <code>Bool</code> and
<code>x</code> and <code>y</code> are expressions of the same type, then
<code>if b then p else q</code> is an expression that evaluates to <code>p</code>
when <code>b</code> is <code>true</code> and <code>q</code> when <code>b</code> is <code>false</code>.
For example, <code>if 1 &lt; x &amp;&amp; x &lt; 10 then "OK" else "Out of Range"</code>
will evaluate to the string <code>"OK"</code> whenever <code>x</code> is strictly
between 1 and 10, and <code>"Out of Range"</code> otherwise.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Question:</SPAN> Write a function named <code>myAnd</code> which takes two
arguments, <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>. Just using <code>if-then-else</code>, the
constants <code>true</code> and <code>false</code>, and the variables <code>x</code> and
<code>y</code>, it should produce the same result as the expression
<code>x &amp;&amp; y</code>. That is, it should produce <code>true</code> when <code>x</code> and
<code>y</code> are both <code>true</code>, and <code>false</code> otherwise, but you may
not use the built-in <code>&amp;&amp;</code> operator.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Char</STRONG></DT>
<DD>The HasCl type <code>Char</code> can represent any single
character.  It is essentially identical to the <code>char</code> type in C++,
even using the same single-quote syntax: <code>'a'</code> is the character
<code>a</code>.  If you want a single-quote character, HasCl uses the same
backslash escape mechanism as C++: <code>'\''</code>.  Here are some more
escape codes for characters that are otherwise hard to type:
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<TABLE CELLPADDING=3>
<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT"><code>\n</code></TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">newline</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT"><code>\r</code></TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">carriage return</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT"><code>\t</code></TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">tab</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT"><code>\v</code></TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">vertical tab</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT"><code>\a</code></TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">bell</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT"><code>\f</code></TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">form feed</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT"><code>\b</code></TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">backspace</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT"><code>\\</code></TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">backslash</TD>
</TR>
<TR><TD ALIGN="LEFT"><code>\'</code></TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">single-quote</TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT"><code>\"</code></TD>
<TD ALIGN="LEFT">double-quote</TD>
</TR>
</TABLE>
</DIV>
Unlike C++, a <code>Char</code> does not automatically convert to an integer.
If you want the ASCII code for a character, use the <code>ord</code> function.
To convert from an ASCII code back to a character, use the <code>chr</code>
function.  For example, <code>ord('A')</code> returns 65, while <code>chr(48)</code>
gives <code>'0'</code>.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Question:</SPAN> Given that the ASCII codes of the digits are
consecutive numbers from 48 for <code>'0'</code> to 57 for <code>'9'</code>, write a
function named <code>digitToNum</code> that takes a digit <code>d</code> of type
<code>Char</code> and produces the corresponding <code>Num</code>. For example,
<code>digitToNum('7')</code> should produce the result <code>7</code> (note that the
result is the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">number</SPAN> 7, not the <SPAN  CLASS="textit">character</SPAN> <code>'7'</code>).

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>String</STRONG></DT>
<DD>As with many other parts of the <code>HasCl</code> language,
the syntax for strings is essentially the same as in C++.  That is, a
string constant is a sequence of characters surrounded by double-quotes:
<code>"Like this"</code>.  The same escape codes as listed above may be used
to embed ``difficult'' characters in strings:
<code>"My favorite string is \"Hello World\"."</code>  However, unlike C and
C++, where strings are arrays of characters (reflecting the importance
of the array in those languages), in HasCl a <code>String</code> is a
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">list</SPAN> of elements of type <code>Char</code>.  We will see more about
lists below, but one of the implications for strings is that the common
operation of appending two strings is achieved by using the list append
operator, <code>++</code>.  For example, <code>"Hello" ++ "World"</code> evaluates
to <code>"HelloWorld"</code>.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Question:</SPAN> Write a function named <code>echo</code> that takes a
string <code>s</code> and produces a new string with <code>s</code> followed by
<code>s</code> again in parentheses.  For example, <code>echo("Hello")</code> should
evaluate to <code>"Hello (Hello)"</code>.

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Pairs and Tuples</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Several values may be packaged into a single
data item by wrapping them in a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">tuple</SPAN>.  A tuple is written as
a comma-separated sequence of values in parentheses:
<code>(42, 'a', "Hello", true)</code>.  There may be any number of values
(even none at all) in a tuple; the special case of two values is called
a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">pair</SPAN>.  The order of the values matters, so the pair
<code>(1, 2)</code> is different from the pair <code>(2, 1)</code>.  The type
of a tuple is written as a tuple of types, so these pairs each have
type <code>(Num, Num)</code>, while the first tuple above has type
<code>(Num, Char, String, Bool)</code>.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Question:</SPAN> Invent an expression which has the type
<code>(Bool, Char, String)</code>.  Now find an expression whose type is
<code>((Bool, Char), String)</code> (note the extra parentheses).

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Lists</STRONG></DT>
<DD>Tuples can hold a variety of types of values; they are
roughly analogous to structs in C++ (although the fields are accessed only
by position, not by name).  One disadvantage of using a tuple is that
a particular tuple type will always contain the same number of values.
If we want to store a varying number of values in a single data object,
we use a <SPAN  CLASS="textit">list</SPAN>.  In this sense, lists are the HasCl equivalent
of arrays in C++; however, lists are a more abstract concept than arrays
(since an array is tied to a specific storage mechanism in memory), and
HasCl provides many powerful operations on lists that have no direct
equivalents in C++ arrays.  The tradeoff for this added power is that
all of the data items in a list have to be of the same type; it is not
possible to mix numbers with characters or strings in a single list.

<P>
The basic way to write a list of values is to enclose them in square
brackets, separated by commas.  For example, <code>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</code> is
a list of five numbers, starting with <code>1</code> at the head of the list.
Just as with tuples, the order matters, so <code>[2, 5, 3, 1, 4]</code> is a
different list, even though it contains the same values.  Since each of
these values is of type <code>Num</code>, we write the type of the list
as <code>[Num]</code>.  There is an abbreviation for lists which
consist of a regular sequence of values:  <code>[1 .. 5]</code> gives the list
<code>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</code>.

<P>
As mentioned above, a <code>String</code> is just a list of <code>Char</code>s.
The notation <code>"Hello"</code> gives exactly the same list as
<code>['H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']</code>.  Note that a list of <code>Strings</code>
is <SPAN  CLASS="textit">not</SPAN> the same; <code>["Hello", "World"]</code> is a list with two
elements, each of which is a list of characters (coincidentally, each
one is five characters long, but recall that a given type of list can
have any number of elements).  The type of <code>["Hello", "World"]</code>
is <code>[String]</code>; since <code>String</code> is a synonym for <code>[Char]</code>,
this can also be written <code>[[Char]]</code> (a list of lists of characters).

<P>
The fundamental operations on lists allow us to take them apart and
put them together.  Given a list, we may remove the first element
with <code>head</code>, and obtain the list of all <SPAN  CLASS="textit">except</SPAN> the first
element with <code>tail</code>:  <code>head([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])</code> is <code>1</code>,
while <code>tail([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])</code> is <code>[2, 3, 4, 5]</code>.  A new list may
be formed from a head element and a tail list with the colon operator:
for example, <code>[1 : [2, 3, 4, 5]]</code> produces <code>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</code>.
An entire list may be put together in this way, with the initial tail
list being the empty list, <code>[]</code>.  That is, <code>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</code>
is equivalent to <code>[1 : [2 : [3 : [4 : [5 : []]]]]]</code>.  Instead of
the colon syntax, the head and tail of a string may be indicated with a
tilde (<code>~</code>) separating them, so <code>"Hello"</code> is short
for <code>"H" ~ "e" ~ "l" ~ "l" ~ "o" ~ ""</code>.
If you ask the type of <code>[]</code>, the system will say <code>[] :: [a]</code>,
which is read ``<code>[]</code> has the type list of <code>a</code>, where <code>a</code>
can be <SPAN  CLASS="textit">any</SPAN> type.''
Trying to take the <code>head</code> or <code>tail</code> of an empty list produces
an error (try <code>head(tail([1]))</code>).

<P>
We have seen a number of other operations on lists already.  The operator
<code>++</code> will append two lists of the same type, so
<code>[1, 2] ++ [3, 4, 5]</code> produces <code>[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]</code>.  The
<code>reverse</code> function produces a list with all the same elements as
its argument, but in the opposite order:  <code>reverse("Hello")</code> gives
<code>"olleH"</code>.  The <code>length</code> function counts how many elements are
in a list; if you do <code>length([])</code>, the answer is <code>0</code>, while
<code>length(["Hello", "World"])</code> is <code>2</code> (and
<code>length(head(["Hello", "World"]))</code> is <code>5</code>).  Given lists of
numbers, <code>sum</code> and <code>product</code> will add or multiply all of the
numbers together.

<P>
A more interesting operation is <code>map</code>, which takes two arguments.
The first is a one-argument function and the second is a list; <code>map</code>
applies the function to each of the elements of the list and returns
the list of results.  For example, <code>map(sqrt, [1 .. 10])</code> produces
a list of the square roots of the numbers from 1 to 10; it is equivalent to
evaluating <code>[sqrt(1), sqrt(2), ..., sqrt(10)]</code> (the <code>...</code> here is not
in the syntax of HasCl; I just didn't feel like typing all ten terms).

<P>
One more function on lists that we have seen is <code>zip</code>.  When
<code>zip</code> is applied to a pair of lists, it creates a list of pairs
of corresponding elements from the two lists, until one or both of the
lists is exhausted.  That is, <code>zip([1, 2, 3], ["Hello", "World"])</code>
produces the list <code>[(1, "Hello"), (2, "World")]</code>; the <code>3</code>
is ignored, because there was no matching element in the second list.

<P>
Lists may be compared for equality; two lists are equal if they have the same length and
if corresponding elements are equal.

<P>
<SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Question:</SPAN> Write a function that tests whether a string
<code>s</code> is a palindrome (that is, it reads the same forwards as
backwards).  For example, <code>isPalindrome("radar")</code> should return
<code>true</code>, while <code>isPalindrome("Madam, I'm Adam")</code> should return
<code>false</code> (that is, the spaces and punctuation matter, as does
capitalization).

<P>
</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Functions</STRONG></DT>
<DD>As seen in the <code>map</code> example above, HasCl allows
functions to be used as values and passed as arguments to other
functions. HasCl is known as a ``functional'' language, partly because
of this treatment of functions as first-class values (that is, they are
treated just like the other basic types of the language). The type of a
function which takes an argument of type <code>a</code> and produces a result
of type <code>b</code> is <code>(a) -&gt; b</code>, which is an ASCII approximation of
the usual mathematical notation <!-- MATH
 $\verb|a|\rightarrow\verb|b|$
 -->
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><code>a</code> <IMG
 WIDTH="20" HEIGHT="14" ALIGN="BOTTOM" BORDER="0"
 SRC="img1.png"
 ALT="$ \rightarrow$"> <code>b</code></SPAN> (the
parentheses around the argument type <code>a</code> are to remind us of the
parentheses around the argument in a function call; this is similar to
C++, where we say that if <code>f</code> is a function that takes an argument
of type <code>a</code> and produces a result of type <code>b</code>, then the
<SPAN  CLASS="textit">prototype</SPAN> for <code>f</code> is <code>b f(a);</code>). To express the type of
<code>map</code>, note that <code>map</code> takes a function of any type
<code>(a) -&gt; b</code>, as well as a list of type <code>[a]</code>; the result, after applying
the function to each element of the list, will be of type <code>[b]</code>.
Therefore, the system will inform us that
<code>map :: ((a) -&gt; b, [a]) -&gt; [b]</code> (try it).
