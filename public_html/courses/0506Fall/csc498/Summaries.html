<dt>Benjamin M. Brown, "Furthering the Online Marketplace</dt>
			
<dd>
				
<p>
					This project will consist of an interactive online
					convenience store entirely rendered in 3D. Users will be
					able to explore the store, walk through it, and purchase
					items as they would in a real store. The level of graphic
					detail will be high. This store will be accessible by a URL
					and will be viewed entirely in the user&rsquo;s internet browser.
					The focus of the project is to unify concepts of computer
					graphics, web design, user interactivity, and database
					interaction. The goal is to simulate a real store as closely
					as possible, while giving the user an enjoyable and
					entertaining experience, hopefully resulting in a more
					efficient and stimulating online shopping experience.

<p>
					I am designing a network utility that will allow students
					and faculty the ability to view current computer lab usage
					throughout campus. The utility will also allow
					administrators of the labs to be able to send messages to
					computer users, and they will be able to keep track of
					computer usage and be able to view statistical reports based
					upon this data. The utility will consist of each lab
					computer on campus running a daemonic program that will send
					to a server program its current status. The server side of
					the utility will keep track of all the computers and provide
					a GUI to the users where they are able to view how many
					computers are in use in each building, floor, and lab. The
					GUI will consist of a live, updated web page which will show
					visually the usage of computers and labs. This GUI will
					enable students and faculty to &ldquo;scout&rdquo; out where computers
					are available for use.

<dt>Josh Coats, "Computer Aided Mammography Process"</dt>
			
<dd>
				
<p>
					I am offering the topic: Computer Aided Detection (CAD) of
					anomalies in mammography data. In my research this summer,
					at the University of Virginia, I built a prototype of the
					CAD program that I want to implement for my senior project.
					I have titled the program C.A.M.P.: Computer-Aided
					Mammography Process. I have called it this because through
					my research I learned that the technology alone should not
					make diagnoses, a second set of eyes is more helpful, and a
					radiologist should follow some process with this program.
					Having had only had 8 weeks this summer to work on the
					project, there are many things I was not able to integrate
					as of yet; including drawing either circles or boxes around
					abnormalities, segmentation and adding, some artificial
					intelligence so the program would get better at finding
					abnormalities, and ignoring normal lesions, among other
					things. My program is being designed as an aid to the
					radiologist. It is not intended to take over the physician&rsquo;s
					job, it merely acts as a second set of eyes to review the
					mammograms; hence the name, Computer Aided Mammography
					Process (or CAMP). It is to be viewed as a process in which
					the radiologist will review while the computer does its own
					review, once the doctor is finished he can bring up the same
					images up on the screen, or print them off, and the program
					will have marked areas of concern for the doctor to look at.

<dt>Matthew Cable, "Wireless Music: WiMus"</dt>
			
<dd>
				
<p>
					My senior project will consist of two programming
					applications that allow a Windows XP desktop computer to
					wirelessly stream music to a Personal Digital Assistant
					(PDA). The vision for this project is that a person with a PDA
					will be able to store large amounts of music on their home
					computer system. They will be able to take their PDA
					anywhere in the world and connect back to their server
					computer to access their songs. They can then plug
					headphones into their PDA or plug their PDA&rsquo;s audio output
					jack into a home theater receivers audio input jack and
					&lsquo;take&rsquo; their music anywhere they want. A server application
					can be installed on any regular Windows operating system
					machine and the song files will all be in .mp3 format and be
					stored using a database of a similar data structure. The
					server should have options to allow the user to import .mp3
					music files and display them properly. The PDA will then
					have a client application which will connect through a
					wireless network, via IP address, back to the database of
					music on the server. The client application will then
					authenticate itself and display the music bank in a user
					friendly manner. The client application should have a search
					engine to find specific songs, artists, and album titles
					easily and quickly. The user can then plug their PDA into
					any home theater receiver or set of speakers or headphones
					and listen to songs as the wirelessly stream to the PDA.

<dt>Tod Karpinski, "DyKnow Remote Desktop Tools"</dt>
			
<dd>
				
<p>
					This project consists of extending the DyKnow Vision product
					to include Remote Desktop Tools. These tools would allow a
					teacher or administrator to remotely control another
					computer with DyKnow installed. It would use the
					pre-existing infrastructure from DyKnow&rsquo;s Demonstration
					mode, which collects the video output from a machine and
					transmits it to many other machines. The features included
					in the Remote Control would include: mouse and keyboard
					interaction, interactive chat, and remote file installation
					and execution. This will allow the teacher to use DyKnow in
					the class room as both an administrative tool and a
					corrective tool, for example a teacher can demonstrate to a
					student on their own computer what needs to be done within
					the class.

<h3>Section B (Howard)</h3>
		
<dl>
			
<dt>Chad Arnold, "Media Rental Services"</dt>
			
<dd>
				
<p>
					My project will be directed toward a potential start-up
					video outlet. It will consist of two parts. The first part
					will be a desktop application that can be used in the local
					store to keep track and maintain a video collection
					including all relevant video information in addition to new
					and potential customers. To store all of the relevant
					information, it will have a database backend. This database
					will also be connected to a data-driven website where
					customers who wish to stay at home will be able to check the
					availability of movies in addition to ordering movies
					online.
				</p>

				
<p>
					This project, although created for a video outlet company,
					has many advantages outside of the movie and gaming
					industry. The program and concepts can be easily tailored
					for similar companies and adapted for other practical
					applications.
				</p>
			
</dd>
			
			
<dt>Zach Harris, "Dynamic Online Purchase Orders"</dt>
			
<dd>
				
<p>
					I am proposing to bring a purchase order/business form file
					maker into an online password protected environment that
					capitalizes on the information distribution, specifying and
					ordering process. It will be simple to use, simple to update
					and maintain, and provide a "purchase order" type
					configuration structure that allows the builder to click on
					options. My example for this project will contain technology
					related items, but this website will be dynamic and can be
					used by any company. The key is to allow a company or
					company&rsquo;s sales person to walk the client through all of the
					options that a company has to offer, and click them off
					while adding up a total price for all the options. By
					"submitting" the company would receive the order via e-mail.
					The purchasing format should include standard necessary
					information like the builder&rsquo;s info, subdivision, lot #,
					wiring date needed, homeowner&rsquo;s name, address, phone number
					etc. In order to bring the proposal into action I plan to
					use PHP and Oracle for my programming needs. I will create a
					database that will hold the information of the clients and
					then can be read from when creating online forms, email
					purchase orders, or filling out forms.

<dt>Alexander Iliev, "The Complexity of Clickomania"</dt>
			
<dd>
				
<img alt="Clickomania screen shot" src="clickomania.png" align="right">
				<p>
					In this project I will explore different approaches to solve
					the puzzle known variously as Clickomania and Same Game. The
					rules of the game are simple. You are given a grid of size
					N&times;M (1&le;N&le;50, 1&le;M&le;50).
					Initially, each cell/tile in the grid is colored in one of K
					different colors, (2&le;K&le;7). Neighboring cells of
					the same color form groups. At each move, the player can
					click on a group of at least 2 cells, which results in the
					disappearance of the group. Cells that are positioned above
					this region slide down to fill in the hole. In case an
					entire column has been removed, all cells to the right of
					the column are shifted one position to the left (see fig.).
					When a region of C cells has been removed, the player
					receives (C-1)&sup2; credits. In case the player manages to
					remove all tiles from the grid, his score is doubled. The
					goal is to maximize the score in the game.
				</p>

				
<p>
					Even though the rules are simple and the game is very
					intuitive, finding the sequence of moves that maximizes your
					score is an NP-complete problem. In this project I will
					develop two competing algorithms that give approximate
					solutions &ndash; one using a heuristic function, and the second
					one &ndash; using the concepts of machine learning.
				</p>

<dt>Antonio Mercado, "Peer-2-Peer at Its Finest"</dt>
			
<dd>
				
<p>
					My project will be a hybrid peer-2-peer program that will
					utilize a central server to gain file information about a
					user before actually connecting to the user to retrieve
					files. There will be login and password capabilities for the
					program, and if you are not registered by the server, you
					will not be able to use the service. Once a successful login
					is reached, the user will be able to request a list of users
					that are on the network. The user will then be able to view
					the types of files that the other users are sharing and
					proceed to connect to them to retrieve the files and stay
					connected creating a network with every additional
					connection. The interface will be command prompt and very
					user friendly. The types of files that are going to be
					capable of downloading will be image, text, and music files.
					Having a central server will also allow instant messenger
					capabilities and being able to view different properties of
					different users. It will be fun and easy to use, and for
					those who are completely computer handicap I will try to
					make it so user friendly that the only thing that would
					prevent the user from using it is illiteracy.

				Ayokunle Olowoyeye, "Remotely Monitoring and Controlling a Web
				Camera"
			</dt>
			
<dd>
				
<p>
					For my project I will write a program that will allow a user
					to monitor his/her room by controlling their web camera from
					the internet. The extent of this control will allow the user
					to pan left and right and if I have time up and down, so
					basically along a horizontal and vertical axis. Using a
					Visual Basic ASP.NET web application I will allow the user
					to upload and refresh screen grabs from the camera in
					real-time. I also plan on including a motion sensor that
					will turn on a light every time motion is detected in the
					room. I hope to set up the motion sensor so that it goes off
					according to a timer such as every 30 seconds. This
					information will be logged into a simple database showing
					the date and time of the intrusion which can be viewed from
					internet. Access control will be implemented in the form of
					forced login to the website.
				</p>
				
<p>
					If time permits I hope to set up the camera so that it takes
					a snapshot every time the motion sensor detects motion. Also
					I plan on adding temperature sensor functionality using
					Phidgets (<a href="http://www.phidgets.com/"><code>www.Phidgets.com</code></a>).

<dt>Matt Stone, "Comparison of OpenGL programming in C++ and Java"</dt>
			
<dd>
				
<p>
					This project consists of creating a 3D environment using
					Java OpenGL (JOGL). The environment will consist of roughly
					7-10 different 3D objects, as well as several different
					lighting sources. The environment will also be navigatable,
					allowing the user to "fly" through it and observe the
					objects from different angles.
				</p>

				
<p>
					The project will be comparing the bindings used in JOGL
					versus the OpenGL bindings used in C++. The main focus will
					be analyzing the differences in the languages, which will be
					compared and contrasted in order to show the strengths and
					weaknesses of using each language for OpenGL programming.
					This knowledge could be used by the current Graphics
					professor in order to decide which language would be better
					suited for teaching the class.
				</p>

<dt>Stephen Topper, "Algorithms for Searching a Proteomic Database"</dt>
			
<dd>
				
<p>
					The field of bioinformatics is heavily dependent on computers.  Due to
					the complexity of DNA sequences, analysis of proteomic data must be
					done by computers.  However, even with the computerized assistance,
					some analysis, especially comparison of protein sequences, can still
					take a long time.  This makes minimization of running time a critical
					factor.  This project will implement several different algorithms
					designed to take a protein sequence as a query and return the top
					ten most closely related sequences from a proteomic database.
				</p>
				
				
<p>
					These algorithms will require the creation of a simple database to
					store proteomic information.  In addition, a sufficient amount of
					sequences will have to be added to the database in order to have
					something to search.  The main points of the project, however,
					are the algorithms that will be implemented.  Two algorithms that
					will be implemented are widely used substitution matrices for
					sequence comparison, PAM and BLOSUM.  These matrices compare two
					sequences based on identity of the sequences and chance of
					mutation for each position in the sequence.  A basic identity
					search will also be implemented.

<h3>Section C (Olowoyeye)</h3>
		
<dl>
			
<dt>Kofi Boateng, "Single-Player Checkers Using OpenGL &amp; A.I.</dt>
			
<dd>
				
<p>
					This project will be a game of checkers. The graphics
					language, OpenGL, will be used to design the user interface
					for the game. The game will have a 2D look though it will be
					designed in 3D. Everything relating to game playing will be
					programmed to appear in a 2D environment. This means the
					interface the user will see will be in 2D. The main purpose
					of the game is to have a human player try to beat a computer
					opponent which will be equipped with Artificial Intelligence
					(A.I.). The computer will use alpha-beta search to look
					ahead during a game before it makes its move. The computer
					will use heuristics to evaluate its position on the board
					before applying the alpha-beta search. This is because
					alpha-beta search for checkers space is too large to be
					exhausted in the search. In this way the search will only
					apply to the immediate area around the computer&rsquo;s position.

<dt>David Mack, "DePauw&rsquo;s Online Auction House"</dt>
			
<dd>
				
<p>
					My proposal for my senior project is to create an online
					auction house for DePauw students. This site will be
					designed in PHP, using an Oracle database. The PHP version
					being used is PHP 4. The Oracle database will be housed on the
					Jupiter server at DePauw, similar to the databases used in
					the Data Driven Websites class taught by Professor Carl
					Singer. Since the assignment requires an ER map, I will give
					a basic outline of the goals I have for the website and then
					the ER model. The underlying purpose of my idea is to create
					a website that allows students to sell at auction items that
					they don&rsquo;t need after the semester, like books and
					refrigerators. Since the website will be designed solely for
					the campus, the necessity of money exchange via the mail is
					eliminated, because students will be able to go to one
					another's rooms in order to pick up the item. Consequently
					the security of the database will be of less importance. I
					will create a password entry system, with a log out based on
					time, but since no credit cards are involved, nothing more
					than authentication will be necessary. The future
					application of this website would generate money by charging
					students a nominal fee to list things, but since this
					function might be provided by the university, the
					proprietary aspect isn&rsquo;t of utmost importance at this time.

<dt>
				Morgan Bates, "A Japanese Kanji Website for Teaching Correct
				Stroke Order"
			</dt>
			
<dd>
				
<p>
					I plan to create a database driven website that would help
					teach the Japanese form of writing, Kanji. Kanji is the most
					difficult of the writing styles that the Japanese have. Not
					only are there thousands of Kanji, but some Kanji have
					upwards of 20 strokes to a single character. They also must
					be drawn in a certain way, that is there is a distinct
					stroke order to each one. What I plan to do is to imbed a
					Java applet, or JavaScript program into the website. This
					program will let the students draw the kanji on the screen,
					and record the order of the strokes that they make. I plan
					to have not only a practice area to the site but also a quiz
					area. In the practice area they will be able to just draw
					kanji on the screen and replay the images that they have
					drawn if they want to. It will also store those kanji in a
					section of the database so the teacher will know that they
					have been practicing. In the quiz section the teacher will
					be able to set up a quiz with questions about how to draw
					certain kanji or if a recorded kanji that they have drawn is
					correct or incorrect. The student will then take the quiz
					and their answers will be placed in the data base for later
					checking.

<dt>Michael Oren and Kyle Shipley, "Interface Design for the Visually Impaired"</dt>
			
<dd>
				
<p>
					The goal of this project is to create an aural video game
					for the visually impaired. We plan to utilize user study
					techniques to design and implement a game that relies on
					spatial sound as the primary interface while also providing
					a graphical interface for those with limited vision with the
					goal of not giving either style of play an advantage. This
					program will utilize some artificial intelligence, graphics,
					and rely very heavily on human computer interaction theory
					and practice. If time allows, this game will also be
					expanded to include some networking features in order to
					allow individuals to play against one another.
