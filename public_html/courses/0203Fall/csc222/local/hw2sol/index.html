<UL>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Exercise 6.5.</SPAN> <I>Give all sequences of three compare-exchange operations
that will sort three elements (see Program 6.1).</I>

The context of this and the next question is in Median-of-Three
partitioning for Quicksort (Section 7.5).  In Program 7.4, the first,
middle, and last elements of the subfile to be sorted are arranged in
order by the sequence of statements
<PRE>
compexch(a[l], a[r-1]);
compexch(a[l], a[r]);
compexch(a[r-1], a[r]);
</PRE>
(recall that the middle element has already been swapped into position
<code>r-1</code>).  The question is, what other sequences of compares and
exchanges will guarantee that the three elements will be put in order?

Suppose that our three elements are <code>a[1]</code>, <code>a[2]</code>, and
<code>a[3]</code>, and let us write <code>i-j</code> for the operation
<code>compexch(a[i], a[j])</code>.  Let's analyze the cases:

<UL>
<LI>If the first operation is <code>1-2</code>, then we know that the
smaller of the first two elements will be put in position 1 and the
larger in position 2.  The second operation will have to compare
one of these with element 3.  If we compare 1 and 3, then we will
know the smallest of the three elements; it should go to position 1,
so the operation should be <code>1-3</code> (since <code>3-1</code> would put
the smallest up in position 3).  If instead we compare 2 and 3 on
the second operation, then we will find out the largest element; we
want it to go to position 3, so the operation should be <code>2-3</code>.
In either case, once we get the smallest or largest value in
position, we just need to compare and exchange the other two values
to get them in place, which gives us our third operation.  This
gives us two possible sequences starting with <code>1-2</code>:
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<code>1-2</code>, <code>1-3</code>, <code>2-3</code>
<BR>
<code>1-2</code>, <code>2-3</code>, <code>1-2</code>

</DIV>

</LI>
<LI>Now, if the first operation is <code>1-3</code>, then similar
reasoning gives us the following possible sequences:
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<code>1-3</code>, <code>1-2</code>, <code>2-3</code>
<BR>
<code>1-3</code>, <code>2-3</code>, <code>1-2</code>

</DIV>

</LI>
<LI>If the first operation is <code>2-1</code>, then that means that the
smaller of the first two elements will be in position 2; if we now
compare it against the value in position 3, we will find the smallest
value after two operations, but it will be in either position 2 or 3,
which does no good if we can only do one more operation to get the
values in order.  Therefore, the only choice we have for the second
operation is to compare positions 1 and 3; this will find the largest
value, so the operation should be <code>1-3</code> (since <code>3-1</code> would
put the largest in position 1).  After this, the third operation needs
to arrange the smallest and middle values, so it must be <code>1-2</code>.
That is, we have found only one possible sequence starting with <code>2-1</code>:
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<code>2-1</code>, <code>1-3</code>, <code>1-2</code>

</DIV>

</LI>
<LI>If the first operation is <code>2-3</code>, then by reasoning similar
to the first two cases we get the following possible sequences:
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<code>2-3</code>, <code>1-2</code>, <code>2-3</code>
<BR>
<code>2-3</code>, <code>1-3</code>, <code>1-2</code>

</DIV>

</LI>
<LI>If the first operation is <code>3-1</code>, then we are stuck.  Comparing
1 and 2 will give us the largest value, but it won't be in position 3.
Similarly, comparing 2 and 3 can find the smallest value on the second
operation, but it can't put it into position 1.  Therefore, no sequences
of three compare-exchanges can start with <code>3-1</code>.

</LI>
<LI>Finally, if the first operation is <code>3-2</code>, then we have a
situation similar to the third case above, for <code>2-1</code>.  The second
operation must be <code>1-3</code>, which puts the smallest value in position 1.
The third operation then has to be <code>2-3</code>, so our eighth and final
possible sequence is
<DIV ALIGN="CENTER">
<code>3-2</code>, <code>1-3</code>, <code>2-3</code>

</DIV>
</LI>
</UL>

</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Exercise 6.6.</SPAN> <I>Give a sequence of five compare-exchange operations that
will sort four elements.</I>

Here is one solution; I don't know how many there are:  <code>1-2</code>,
<code>3-4</code>, <code>1-3</code>, <code>2-4</code>, <code>2-3</code>.  The first two steps
force the smallest item to be in either position 1 or 3,
so the third step chooses between them and puts the smallest into
position 1.  The first two steps also force the largest item to
be in either position 2 or 4, so the fourth step resolves
the situation by putting the largest into 4.  Finally, the two
middle elements must be in positions 2 and 3, so the last
step arranges them in proper order.

Incidentally, it is easy to prove that these numbers cannot be improved.
Since each <code>compexch</code> operation puts just two items in order, it
can only cut the number of possible orderings of the elements down by a
factor of two (the ultimate goal of a sorting procedure is to force any
initial ordering into one particular one, so we can view each step as
cutting down the range of possible permutations until only one remains).
There are 6 possible orderings of three elements, so if two operations
would only cut the possibilities down by a factor of 4, that is not
enough.  Similarly, there are 24 possible permutations of four elements
(recall that, in general, there are <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I>!</SPAN> permutations of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>n</I></SPAN> elements);
four operations could only cut this down by a factor of at most 16, so
they would not be sufficient.

</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Exercise 6.14.</SPAN> <I>Is selection sort stable?</I>

No.  When placing a selected item into position, the item that was in
that spot previously will be swapped to an arbitrary location in the unsorted
portion of the file, possibly passing over other items with the same
key.  For example, look at the items <SPAN  CLASS="textsf">S</SPAN> and <SPAN  CLASS="textsf">S'X</SPAN> in the
figure above.

</DIV>

</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Exercise 6.18.</SPAN> <I>Is insertion sort stable?</I>

Yes.  Since each item is moved to the left only as long as it passes
items with strictly higher keys, the relative order of items with the
same key will never change.

</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Exercise 6.22.</SPAN> <I>Is bubble sort stable?</I>

Yes.  As each item bubbles to the left, it stops when it sees an item
whose key is less than or equal to its own; therefore, no item will pass
another item with the same key.

</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Exercise 6.26.</SPAN> <I>Which of the three elementary methods (selection sort,
insertion sort, or bubble sort) runs fastest for a file with all keys
identical?</I>

Insertion sort will be the fastest, because it only has to make <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I> - 1</SPAN>
comparisons and no exchanges.  Bubble sort (with the optimization that
it quits after a pass in which no exchanges are performed) will be
almost as fast, except it needs to do the extra work to check whether
the file is sorted after making the pass.  Bubble sort without that
optimization will use about <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I><SUP>2</SUP>/2</SPAN> comparisons, as will selection sort.

</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Exercise 6.27.</SPAN> <I>Which of the three elementary methods runs fastest for a
file in reverse order?</I>

Selection sort will be the fastest, because while all three methods
perform about <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I><SUP>2</SUP>/2</SPAN> comparisons in this case, selection sort will only
do about <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I>/2</SPAN> exchanges; the other two will each do about <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I><SUP>2</SUP>/2</SPAN>
exchanges (every comparison results in an exchange).

</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Exercise 6.33.</SPAN> <I>Is shellsort stable?</I>

No.  When the file is <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN>-sorted for a value of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I> &gt; 1</SPAN>, it is possible for two
items with the same key to switch positions (if they are not a multiple
of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> positions apart, they will not be compared with each other in a
<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN>-sort).  For example, look at the items <SPAN  CLASS="textsf">S</SPAN> and <SPAN  CLASS="textsf">S'X</SPAN> in
the next question.

<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Exercise 6.35.</SPAN> <I>Give diagrams corresponding to Figures 6.8 and 6.9 for
the keys <SPAN  CLASS="textsf">E A S Y Q U E S T I O N</SPAN>.</I>

Using the increment sequence <code>1 4 13 ...</code>, we only need to perform
a 4-sort followed by a 1-sort.  For the 4-sort, first here is the
diagram corresponding to Figure 6.8:

1-sort:

<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Exercise 7.8.</SPAN> <I>About how many comparisons will quicksort
(Program 7.1) make when sorting a file of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> equal elements?</I>

Examining the partitioning step in Program 7.1 reveals that 
when all the keys are equal it will arrange to put the pivot right in the
middle for each subfile.  Since the subfiles decrease in size by a factor
of 2 on each recursive call, there will be <SPAN CLASS="MATH">log<SUB>2</SUB><I>N</I></SPAN> levels of recursion
with about <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> comparisons on each level, for a total of about <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I> log<SUB>2</SUB><I>N</I></SPAN>
comparisons.  This is the best case for quicksort, except for all of the
needless exchanges done while partitioning--since every element is equal
to the pivot, every element will be swapped to the other side.

</LI>
<LI><SPAN  CLASS="textbf">Exercise 7.9.</SPAN> <I>About how many comparisons will quicksort (Program 7.1) make
when sorting a file consisting of <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I></SPAN> items that have just two different
key values (<SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>k</I></SPAN> items with one value, <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I> - <I>k</I></SPAN> items with the other)?</I>

When I assigned this problem, I didn't realize what a proper solution would
involve.  Since this is not really a full-fledged course in algorithm
analysis, we will not look at a complete solution to this problem.  However,
an approximate answer comes from the observation that after the first
partitioning pass, one of the partitions will contain all equal elements,
while the other may contain a mixture (because some of the elements equal
to the pivot may have been swapped over to that side).  Even the partition
with a mixture of elements will probably be more homogeneous than the
original, though, because it will contain all of the elements different
from the pivot, plus only a few of the elements equal to the pivot.
Therefore, after a few passes, each subfile will contain only one kind of
element.  According to the previous exercise, these will continue to be
split evenly until subfiles with only one element are reached; since
most of the passes will split the subfiles evenly, there will be about
<SPAN CLASS="MATH">log<SUB>2</SUB><I>N</I></SPAN> levels of recursion, so again we find about <SPAN CLASS="MATH"><I>N</I> log<SUB>2</SUB><I>N</I></SPAN> comparisons.
