This document and its successor summarize the essential commands needed
to edit, compile, and run programs in the Linux environment. There are
many more detailled tutorials on these topics on the Web; here are a
few:

Getting Started with Unix</A>
</H1>

This tutorial is for those who have never used Unix before. It covers
only the most essential commands that you need to begin with and
indicates where to look to learn more. It is assumed that you have this
document in printed form so that you can go through the steps on the
computer as you read.

<DL>
<DT><STRONG>Log In</STRONG></DT>
<DD>&nbsp;

To begin with, you need to log in to jupiter or one of the other Linux
machines in Julian A216. If you want to log in from across the network,
use <code>telnet jupiter.csc.depauw.edu</code> (more securely, use SSH instead
of TELNET; on Windows you will need to install a client such as
<code>PuTTY</code>, available from
<A HREF="http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/">http://www.chiark.greenend.org.uk/~sgtatham/putty/</A>).  You will
need the username and password from the sheet I gave you on the first
day (and you will probably want to change the password to something more
memorable, with the <code>passwd</code> command).

</DD>
<DT><STRONG>The unix prompt</STRONG></DT>
<DD>&nbsp;

Unix is a command-line operating system. There are no icons to click on.
To make it go, you have to type in commands at what is called ``the unix
prompt''. The prompt is usually the name of the host followed by a
dollar sign, but it varies depending on how the system administrator
has set it up. When the cursor is on the line with this prompt, unix is
awaiting your command. In the examples below, we will assume the 
prompt is ``<code>jupiter$</code>''. You do not type the prompt; you type what comes
after it.

</DD>
<DT><STRONG>Some Essential Commands</STRONG></DT>
<DD>&nbsp;

Here is a walking tour of some essential unix commands:

<OL>
<LI><code>jupiter$ ls</code>
<BR>
This shows a list of the files in the current directory. You might not
have any files yet, so let's make one.

</LI>
<LI><code>jupiter$ cp /etc/motd motd</code>
<BR>
This copies an existing file into the current directory. You own the
copy.

</LI>
<LI><code>jupiter$ ls</code>
<BR>
You should now see ``<code>motd</code>'' among any other files that you have.

</LI>
<LI><code>jupiter$ ls -l</code>
<BR>
Unix commands usually have options to modify how the command behaves.
Options are usually specified by a hyphen followed by a single letter.
In this case the ``<code>-l</code>'' option specifies that you want a ``long''
listing, which shows lots more information that just the file name.

</LI>
<LI><code>jupiter$ cat motd</code>
<BR>
This prints the contents of the file. Notice that this is the ``Message
of the Day'' that appeared when you first logged in. The system
administrator can change this file to inform you about what's new on
this host. But the copy that you made of today's motd is yours and does
not change until you change it yourself.

</LI>
<LI><code>jupiter$ pwd</code>
<BR>
This shows the ``present working directory''. Unless you have gotten way
ahead of me, this is your ``home directory''. You own this directory.
You can create new files in you home directory and modify and delete
them at will. Other users on the system have their own home directories,
and you cannot mess with their files unless they explicitly grant
permissions that allow you access to them.

Take a close look at the output of the <code>pwd</code> command. This is what is
called a ``path'' in unix. Unix organizes files in one big tree, where
each node of the tree has a name. The path is the sequence of nodes the
system needs to follow to get from the root of the tree to your home
directory.

</LI>
<LI><code>jupiter$ mkdir xyz</code>
<BR>
You can build up the unix directory tree starting from your home
directory. The <code>mkdir</code> command makes a new directory. Let's see where unix
put it.

</LI>
<LI><code>jupiter$ ls</code>
<BR>
The <code>xyz</code> directory is within your home directory. Directories can contain
directories as well as files! You can now put files in the <code>xyz</code>
directory.

</LI>
<LI><code>jupiter$ cd xyz</code>
<BR>
This changes your current working directory to the <code>xyz</code> subdirectory.

</LI>
<LI><code>jupiter$ pwd</code>
<BR>
Notice that the <code>xyz</code> node has been added to the path.

</LI>
<LI><code>jupiter$ cat motd</code>
<BR>
This results in an error because there is no file called <code>motd</code> in the
current directory.

</LI>
<LI><code>jupiter$ pico tutorial</code>
<BR>
When you are in <code>pico</code>, there should be a menu at the bottom of the screen.
Type the opening paragraph of this tutorial. Use the cursor keys to move
the cursor around. Use backspace to correct mistakes. When you are
finished hit `Control-O' to save the file and then `Control-X' to quit. (You
need to answer some questions that appear on the message line.) You
should now be out of <code>pico</code> and back at the unix prompt.

</LI>
<LI><code>jupiter$ ls</code>
<BR>
The <code>ls</code> command shows the file in the current directory, which is
the <code>xyz</code> subdirectory. So the files in your home directory do not
appear. The only file that show up at this point is the file that you
just created with the text editor.

</LI>
<LI><code>jupiter$ cd ..</code>
<BR>
The double-period designation in this command is unix notation for the
``parent directory''.

</LI>
<LI><code>jupiter$ pwd</code>
<BR>
You should now be back at your home directory. When you said ``<code>cd ..</code>'',
the current directory moved from <code>xyz</code> to its parent, which is your
home directory. The <code>xyz</code> directory is a ``subdirectory'' of your home
directory. The home directory is the ``parent'' of <code>xyz</code>. A directory may
contain any number of subdirectories, but a directory has one and only
one parent. (Exception: the root directory, whose name is just <code>/</code>, has no parent.)

</LI>
<LI><code>jupiter$ mv motd oldmessage</code>
<BR>
This moves the file. In this case that means that the name of the file
is changed.

</LI>
<LI><code>jupiter$ ls</code>
<BR>
Note that <code>motd</code> is gone, but <code>oldmessage</code> is now there. It is the same
file, but with a different name.

</LI>
<LI><code>jupiter$ mv oldmessage xyz</code>
<BR>
This is different from the previous <code>mv</code> because the destination is a
directory.

</LI>
<LI><code>jupiter$ cd xyz</code>

</LI>
<LI><code>jupiter$ ls</code>
<BR>
Note that <code>oldmessage</code> has been moved into the <code>xyz</code>
subdirectory.

</LI>
<LI><code>jupiter$ cat motd</code>
<BR>
Again this results in an error because there is no file called
<code>motd</code> in the current directory. But we know that there is a file
named <code>motd</code> somewhere in the tree. How do we access it?

</LI>
<LI><code>jupiter$ cat /etc/motd</code>
<BR>
You can always give the ``full path'' name of a file regardless of the
current directory. Full path names begin with a slash (<code>/</code>) and list all
of the nodes in the path from the root directory to the file. In this
case the path is short, but in general there are many nodes to type.

</LI>
<LI><code>jupiter$ cd</code>
<BR>
Sometimes you just want to get back to your home directory. The <code>cd</code> with
no arguments does exactly that.

</LI>
<LI><code>jupiter$ ls xyz</code>
<BR>
This lists the files in the <code>xyz</code> directory.

</LI>
<LI><code>jupiter$ cat xyz/oldmessage</code>
<BR>
This displays the contents of the <code>oldmessage</code> file. This command
illustrates what is called a ``relative path'' name of a file. Since the
path does not begin with a slash (<code>/</code>), the system follows the specified
tree nodes beginning with the current directory. So the path is relative
to the current directory.

</LI>
<LI><code>jupiter$ ls ..</code>
<BR>
The relative path may contain ``<code>..</code>'' to access the parent
directory. This command therefore shows what is in the parent of your
home directory (probably a bunch of other people's home directories).

</LI>
<LI><code>jupiter$ man ls</code>
<BR>
There are many, many commands on a unix system. The printed manual that
explains the syntax and options for each command is several volumes in
size (and very expensive). But the manual pages are installed on-line on
most systems. The <code>man</code> command takes the name of a command or program as
its argument. It displays the manual page for that command or program.
In this case, you see the <code>man</code> page for the <code>ls</code> command.

When you are in the <code>man</code> display, use the following commands:

Now that you know about the <code>man</code> command, you can find out about other
important unix commands. What you should do now is read the <code>man</code> pages in
the list of must-know commands below. These give a lot more detail than
what you need to know to get started, but read the description of what
the command does and skim the rest just to see what information is
available.
