<h1 align="center">Programming Project 2</h1>

<p>By working through the steps in this handout, you will develop
a Haskell program to draw a picture made up of many overlapping
squares of different sizes and colors.</p>

<ol>
<li>The following data type will represent a single square: 
<pre>
data Square = Square Point Int RGB
</pre>

This says that a <code>Square</code> will be specified by a
<code>Point</code> (the center), an <code>Int</code> (the
distance from the center to any of the sides, <span class=
"textit">i.e.</span>, half the length of a side), and a color
expressed as red, green, and blue components. The type
<code>Int</code> is one of the built-in types (it is a variant of
<code>Integer</code> that gives up the very large values in
exchange for greater efficiency); each of the other types is
already defined in the Graphics Library, so we just need to know
how to use them. 
<p>Create a Haskell script file named <code>project2.hs</code> in
your directory on the <code>I:</code> drive. It should start with
the following lines:</p>

<pre>
-- CSC122, Project 2
-- &lt;your name&gt;
-- &lt;the date&gt;

import SOEGraphics

data Square = Square Point Int RGB
</pre>

Now <code>:load</code> your script into Hugs. For this item, all
we will do is construct a <code>Square</code> object. To use the
<code>Square</code> constructor function, we need a
<code>Point</code>, an <code>Int</code>, and an <code>RGB</code>.
A <code>Point</code> is simply a pair of integers, so we can use
something like <code>(200, 100)</code>. An <code>Int</code> is
just a value like <code>50</code>. An <code>RGB</code> needs
three integers in the range 0 to 255; to get white, we can use
the <code>RGB</code> constructor as follows: <code>RGB 255 255
255</code>. Putting all this together, we can form a white
square, 100 units on each side, centered on the point <span
class="MATH">(200, 100)</span>, by using the expression
<code>Square (200, 100) 50 (RGB 255 255 255)</code>. If you type
this in, the system will complain that it cannot find an
appropriate ``show'' function. This is OK; we can still use the
<code>Square</code> type in a program, and we can check that we
are using it correctly by only requesting the type of the above
expression: <code>:type Square (200, 100) 50 (RGB 255 255
255)</code>.</li>

<li>We will need a function to draw one of our
<code>Square</code> objects. The Haskell Graphics library
provides a function <code>polygon</code> which takes a list of
<code>Point</code>s and produces a filled-in shape with the given
points as vertices. We will write a convenience function
<code>fillSquare</code> which takes a <code>Square</code> and
makes the appropriate call to <code>polygon</code>: 
<pre>
fillSquare (Square (x,y) d rgb) = withRGB rgb (polygon [(x-d,y-d),
                                                        (x-d,y+d),
                                                        (x+d,y+d),
                                                        (x+d,y-d)])
</pre>

As usual, we write the function to match its argument against a
pattern so that the variables in the pattern will be bound to the
corresponding values for the <code>Square</code> we wish to draw.
The center point will be <code>(x,y)</code>, the distance from
the center to each side will be <code>d</code>, and the color
will be <code>rgb</code>. We call the <code>polygon</code>
function with an appropriate list of points for the four corners
of the square, and pass the result to the <code>withRGB</code>
function to apply a color to the shape. Add the above function
definition to your script. If you try to apply
<code>fillSquare</code> to the square mentioned previously,
<code>fillSquare (Square (200,100) 50 (RGB 255 255 255))</code>,
the system should again complain about the lack of an appropriate
``show'' function. The result is of the type <code>Draw
()</code>, which the system might also call <code>Graphic</code>.
The square has not been drawn yet, but this <code>Graphic</code>
value packages up all the information that the Graphics Library
will need to display it. The next step will do so.</li>

<li>To display a square on the screen, we need to use the
following function: 
<pre>
showGraphic g = runGraphics $ do {
    w &lt;- openWindow "Graphics Window" (400,300);
    drawInWindow w g;
    getKey w;
    closeWindow w
}
</pre>

Add this to your script, load it, and try applying
<code>showGraphic</code> to the result of various calls to
<code>fillSquare</code>. Each time you do, it should create a
graphics window, display a filled square, and wait for you to hit
any key before closing the window. For testing, it will be
convenient to define some sample squares. Add some lines like the
following to your script and reload: 
<pre>
redGiant = Square (150,150) 100 (RGB 255 0 0)
whiteDwarf = Square (250,250) 25 (RGB 255 255 255)
</pre>

Now you can easily try drawing squares by entering
<code>showGraphic (fillSquare redGiant)</code>, etc., at the
<code>Main&gt;</code> prompt in Hugs. However, this only lets you
draw one square at a time. To combine several squares in one
picture, we need the <code>overGraphic</code> function. It will
be easiest to use this as an operator, as follows:
<code>showGraphic ((fillSquare redGiant) `overGraphic`
(fillSquare whiteDwarf))</code>. Notice how the squares are
combined, and see what happens if you reverse the order of the
squares.</li>

<li>Now let's do a list of <code>Square</code>s. We will need a
function which takes a list of squares, fills each one, and
combines them all into a single <code>Graphic</code>. As usual
when working with a list of things, we will define the function
by recursion. Here is the base case, which uses the special value
<code>emptyGraphic</code> to produce a blank picture: 
<pre>
fillSquareList [] = emptyGraphic
</pre>

The recursive case will have the following form: 
<pre>
fillSquareList (s : ss) =
</pre>

When this pattern matches, <code>s</code> will be the first
square on the list, and <code>ss</code> will be a list of the
remaining squares. Write an appropriate right-hand side for this
case of the function. You will need to use
<code>fillSquare</code> to produce a <code>Graphic</code> from
<code>s</code>, and <code>fillSquareList</code> to produce
another <code>Graphic</code> from <code>ss</code>; then these two
<code>Graphic</code>s will need to be combined into one with
<code>overGraphic</code>. When you have added the function to
your script, try it out with <code>showGraphic (fillSquareList
[redGiant, whiteDwarf])</code>.</li>

<li>We will also want a function to <span class=
"textit">generate</span> a list of squares, so that we don't have
to type them all in by hand. Here is an example: 
<pre>
diagonalSquares (x,y) d rgb 0 = []
diagonalSquares (x,y) d rgb n = Square (x,y) d rgb :
                                diagonalSquares (x+d,y+d) d rgb (n-1)
</pre>

Try this: <code>showGraphic (fillSquareList (diagonalSquares
(50,50) 25 (RGB 255 255 255) 9))</code>. The cases for this
function mean that <code>diagonalSquares (x,y) d rgb n</code>
will produce a list of <code>n</code> squares (because the list
is empty when <code>n</code> is <code>0</code>, and it gets one
extra element for each recursive call as <code>n</code> counts
down to <code>0</code>). The first one will be centered at
<code>(x,y)</code>, with dimension <code>d</code> and color
<code>rgb</code>. Succeeding squares will be offset by adding
<code>d</code> to the <code>x</code> and <code>y</code>
coordinates of the center; the effect will be that each square
will be centered on the lower-right corner of the previous one.
You should get a picture that looks like a white staircase.</li>

<li>A simple modification to the previous code gives us a row of
squares of different sizes. Create a new function named
<code>vanishingSquares</code> which is similar to
<code>diagonalSquares</code> except replace the argument
<code>d</code> in the recursive call (to
<code>vanishingSquares</code>, of course) with the expression
<code>(d `quot` 2)</code>. To try this out, you will probably
want to start with a larger initial square; something like this
should work: <code>showGraphic (fillSquareList (vanishingSquares
(200,100) 80 (RGB 255 255 255) 7))</code></li>

<li>Now we can approach our original goal of creating an
interesting picture by replacing the single recursive call in the
previous item with four separate calls, one at each of the four
corners of the central square. Each of these recursive calls will
produce a list of squares, so we will need to append all of the
lists together, using <code>++</code>. Here is a skeleton of the
code for you to fill in: 
<pre>
squareDesign (x,y) d rgb 0 =
squareDesign (x,y) d rgb n = Square (x,y) d rgb :
                             (squareDesign (x-d,y-d) (d `quot` 2) rgb (n-1) ++
                              squareDesign (x-d,y+d) (d `quot` 2) rgb (n-1) ++
                              squareDesign                                  ++
                              squareDesign                                 )
</pre>

When you have the finished function saved in your script file,
load it into Hugs and try the following: <code>showGraphic
(fillSquareList (squareDesign (200,150) 70 (RGB 255 255 255)
5))</code><br>
You can change the <code>5</code> to <code>6</code> to draw one
more level, but it will probably crash if you try to do 7 or more
levels (each level has four times as many squares, so there are
4096 squares at level 7).</li>

<li>The last step will be to change the color as well as the
size. Modify the recursive calls so that the upper-left and
lower-right corners have only half the red component of the
current square, while the upper-right and lower-left corners have
only half the green component; leave the blue component
untouched. You will need to pattern-match on the color argument
to extract the red, green, and blue components; that is, you will
have something like <code>(RGB r g b)</code> instead of the
simple variable <code>rgb</code>. Call the new function
<code>colorDesign</code>.</li>

<li>As a final problem, how could you change the code to draw the
larger squares on the bottom, instead of on top? Whichever
function needs to be modified, name the new version by appending
a <code>2</code>; for example, if you modify
<code>colorDesign</code>, then your new function should be named
<code>colorDesign2</code>.</li>
</ol>

<p>When you are done, make sure your script file with all of the
above code is saved in your folder on the <code>I:</code>
drive.<br>
