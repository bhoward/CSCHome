<H3>Program Flow Instructions</H3>

All of the previous instructions execute sequentially; that is, when one
instruction finishes, the next instruction is taken from the very next
memory location.  This is the default operation for the instruction
pointer, IP---after each byte of instruction is fetched, the IP is
incremented in preparation for the next fetch.  The program flow
instructions provide the facilities to modify the course of execution,
allowing conditional execution (by jumping over parts of the code if
certain conditions are met) and looping (by jumping backwards in the
code).<P>
The unconditional jump instruction, <TT>JMP</TT>, causes IP (and sometimes
CS) to be modified so that the next instruction is fetched from the
location given in the operand (the <EM>target</EM>).  Here are the valid forms:
<PRE>
        JMP SHORT imm8
        JMP     imm16
        JMP     imm16:imm16
        JMP     r/m16
        JMP FAR mem32
</PRE>
The short version saves space when the target of the jump is within a
few dozen instructions forward or backward; the assembler computes the
difference between the new address and the next address sequentially,
and just stores this difference as one (signed) byte. The second (and
most common) version allows a jump to any location in the current code
segment, while the third allows a jump to any location in memory by also
specifying an immediate value to be loaded into CS. The fourth version
will take the target address from a register or memory location; since
this address is only 16 bits, the target has to be within the segment.
Finally, the far version fetches both the offset and the segment from
four consecutive bytes in memory (compare to the <TT>LDS</TT> and
<TT>LES</TT> instructions; <TT>JMP FAR mem32</TT> could have been called
"<TT>LCS IP, mem32</TT>'').<P>
The conditional jump instructions, <TT>Jcc</TT>, where <TT>cc</TT> is one of
the condition codes listed earlier (<TT>E</TT>, <TT>NE</TT>, ...),
perform a short jump if the condition is true, based on the current
contents of the status flags.  For example, the code sample that was
given in the discussion of <TT>LODSB</TT>, to convert a string to
lower-case, used the <TT>JA</TT> and <TT>JB</TT> instructions; these
made their jump if the result of the previous comparison
found that the current character was above 'Z' or below 'A'.  Since a
conditional jump can only be to a nearby target, it is sometimes
necessary to combine conditional and unconditional jumps as follows:
<PRE>
        JNLE    NoJLE
        JMP     target
NoJLE:
</PRE>
This will have the same effect as <TT>JLE target</TT>, except there is no
restriction on how far away the target may be (within the code segment).<P>
There are two specialized versions of conditional jump that are
particularly useful when executing a loop a fixed number of times.  The
looping statements
<PRE>
        LOOP    imm8
        LOOPE   imm8
        LOOPNE  imm8
</PRE>
(as usual, the synonyms <TT>LOOPZ</TT> and <TT>LOOPNZ</TT> are also
available) are very similar to the <TT>REP</TT>, <TT>REPE</TT>, and
<TT>REPNE</TT> prefixes from the string instructions.  The <TT>LOOP</TT>
instruction decrements CX and makes a short jump if the count has not
reached zero.  The <TT>LOOPE</TT> instruction adds the condition that it
will only take the jump if the Zero flag is set (usually indicating that
the last comparison had equal operands); the <TT>LOOPNE</TT> will only
take the jump if the Zero flag is clear.  The string operation
<TT>REP MOVSB</TT>, for example, could have been performed with
<PRE>
Repeat  MOVSB
        LOOP    Repeat
</PRE>
(except this would have been considerably slower, since it requires
repeatedly fetching and decoding the two instructions instead of just
fetching and decoding the single <TT>REP MOVSB</TT> instruction once).<P>
After looping or repetitive string operations, it is occasionally
necessary to test whether the count register reached zero (to check
whether the loop ran for the full count or whether it exited early
because the Zero flag changed).  The instruction
<PRE>
        JCXZ    imm8
</PRE>
serves exactly this purpose; it takes a short jump if the CX register
contains zero.  It is short for performing <TT>CMP CX, 0</TT> followed by
<TT>JZ imm8</TT>.<P>
All of the above branching instructions are variations on the infamous
<TT>GOTO</TT> statement; they cause a permanent change in the course of
execution.  To perform an operation more like a function or subroutine
call, where the flow of control will eventually return to pick up with
the next instruction, the 8086 provides two mechanisms:
<TT>CALL</TT>/<TT>RET</TT> and <TT>INT</TT>/<TT>IRET</TT>.<P>
The <TT>CALL</TT> instruction offers a similar range of addressing modes
to the <TT>JMP</TT> instruction, except there is no "short'' call:
<PRE>
        CALL    imm16
        CALL    imm16:imm16
        CALL    r/m16
        CALL FAR mem32
</PRE>
A call is the same as a jump, except the instruction pointer is first
pushed onto the stack (in the second and fourth versions, which include
a new segment, the current CS register is also pushed).<P>
To reverse the effect of a <TT>CALL</TT>, when the subroutine is done it
should execute a <TT>RET</TT> or <TT>RETF</TT> instruction; this pops the
return address off of the stack and back into IP (and <TT>RETF</TT> also
pops the saved value of CS, to return from a far call). After the
return, the next instruction that will be fetched will be from the next
location after the <TT>CALL</TT>.  There is an optional 16-bit immediate
operand that may be specified with a return instruction; this value is
added to the stack pointer after popping off the return address, to
recover however many bytes had been pushed onto the stack with
parameters before the call.  For example, here is one way to implement a
subroutine to print a character, where the calling code first pushes the
character (as the low byte of a word, since there is no option to push a
single byte) before making the call:
<PRE>
PutChar PUSH    BP      ;Save current values of registers that we'll modify
        PUSH    AX
        PUSH    DX
        MOV     BP, SP  ;Copy stack pointer to BP
        MOV     AH, 2   ;DOS function code for printing a character
        MOV     DL, [BP + 8]    ;Fetch character parameter from stack
;Stack contains (from tos) DX, AX, BP, return address, and parameter
        INT     21h     ;Call DOS function
        POP     DX      ;Restore modified registers
        POP     AX
        POP     BP
        RET     2       ;Return and pop 2 byte parameter
</PRE>
For completeness, here is what a typical call might look like (in fact,
this is a complete routine to print a NUL-terminated string, assuming
that the string starts at DS:SI):
<PRE>
NextCh  LODSB           ;Load next character into AL
        CMP     AL, 0
        JE      Done    ;Quit if NUL
        PUSH    AX      ;Set up parameter for call
        CALL    PutChar
        JMP     NextCh  ;Continue with next character
Done:
</PRE>
This is just one of several common conventions for passing parameters to
subroutines; even more common is to just specify that, for example, the
character will be passed directly in the DL register.<P>
The other function-call-like mechanism is the <EM>interrupt</EM>.  We have
been using this all along to call the standard DOS services, such as
printing a character or a '$'-terminated string.  The <TT>INT</TT>
instruction behaves much like the <TT>CALL FAR</TT> instruction except for two
things:  it pushes the FLAGS register before pushing CS and IP (the idea
is that an interrupt should be able to completely restore the state of
the processor when it is finished, since this is also the mechanism used
for handling hardware interrupts from the rest of the system---they can
happen at any time, independent of what the processor might be working
on, and they should occur as transparently to the current process as
possible), and it gets the target address from a standard table of
<EM>interrupt handler vectors</EM> kept at the bottom of memory.  When the
processor executes <TT>INT n</TT>, where <TT>n</TT> is an 8-bit immediate
value, it fetches a far pointer (that is, a 4-byte combination of
segment and offset) from the memory address <TT>0000:4n</TT>; this is the
target address for the interrupt call.  For example, the address of the
DOS interrupt handler, the routine called when <TT>INT 21h</TT> is
executed, is stored at locations <TT>0000:0084</TT> through
<TT>0000:0087</TT>; the first two bytes give the offset, to load into IP,
and the second two bytes give the segment, to load into CS.<P>
To return from an interrupt handler, the <TT>IRET</TT> instruction is
used.  It pops the IP, CS, and FLAGS registers, which causes the state
of the machine to return to where it left off when the interrupt
occurred.<P>
