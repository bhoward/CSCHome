<H3>Addressing Modes</H3>

Operands may be specified in one of three basic forms:  immediate,
register, and memory.<P>
An immediate operand is just a number (or a label, which the assembler
converts to the corresponding address). An immediate operand is used to
specify a constant for one of the arithmetic or logical operations, or
to give the jump address for a branching instruction. Most assemblers,
including NASM, allow simple arithmetic expressions when computing
immediate operands. For example, all of the following are equivalent:
<PRE>
        MOV     AL, 13
        MOV     AL, 0xD
        MOV     AL, 0Ah + 3 ;Note leading 0 to distinguish from register AH
        MOV     AL, George * 2 - 1
</PRE>
assuming that the label George is associated with the address 7.<P>
A register operand is one of the eight general- and special-purpose
16-bit registers listed above, or one of the eight general-purpose 8-bit
registers (AL, AH, ...), or one of the four segment registers.  The
contents of the register are used and/or modified by the operation.  In
the example above, the destination operand of the <TT>MOV</TT> instruction
is the low byte of the accumulator, AL; the effect of the instruction is
to store the binary number 00001101 into the bottom eight bits of AX
(leaving the other bits unchanged).<P>
A memory operand gives the address of a location in main memory to use
in the operation. The NASM syntax for this is very simple: put the
address in square brackets. The address can be given as an arithmetic
expression involving constants and labels (the <EM>displacement</EM>),
plus an optional base or index register. Here are some examples:
<PRE>
        MOV     DX, [1234h]
        ADD     DX, [BX + 8]
        MOV     [BP + SI], DL
        INC     BYTE [0x100 + CS:DI]	
</PRE>
A few of comments are needed on these examples.  In the third
example, the address is given by the sum of the contents of BP and SI;
you can imagine that there is a default displacement of zero here, so
the address is <TT>0 + BP + SI</TT>.  In the first example, the
destination is 16 bits wide, so a 16-bit quantity will be fetched from
two adjacent memory locations:  DL will be loaded with the byte from
<TT>1234h</TT>, and DH will be loaded from <TT>1235h</TT>.  The same will
happen in the second example:  DL will have the contents of address
<TT>BX + 8</TT> added to it, and DH will have the contents of address
<TT>BX + 9</TT> added (plus any carry from the low byte).  In the third
example, the source is only 8 bits wide, so only the byte at address
<TT>BP + SI</TT> will be changed.  Finally, in the fourth example, the
<TT>INC</TT> operation by itself is ambiguous about whether it is
incrementing a single byte or a full 16-bit word; the keyword
<TT>BYTE</TT> in front of the operand determines that only the byte at the
address <TT>100h + DI</TT> will be affected (the alternative would be to
use the keyword <TT>WORD</TT>, to add 1 to the combination of bytes at
<TT>100h + DI</TT> and <TT>101h + DI</TT>).<P>
All of these addresses are really offsets into a particular segment. In
the fourth example, the code segment is explicitly called for by the
segment override <TT>CS:</TT>. The default segment is the data segment,
except when the base register BP is involved, in which case the stack
segment is used (as in the third example).<P>
As one more example of a memory operand, consider the following sequence
of instructions:
<PRE>
        MOV     BX, 100h
        MOV     SI, 20h
        MOV     AL, [BX + SI + 3]
</PRE>
The <EM>effective address</EM> of the third move instruction is computed
by adding the contents of the BX and SI registers, plus the constant 3;
therefore, the byte that is moved into AL comes from address <TT>0123h</TT>
(interpreted as an offset within the data segment).<P>
