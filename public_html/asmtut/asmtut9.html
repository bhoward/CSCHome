<H2>NASM Commands</H2>

The NetWide Assembler, <A HREF="http://www.cryogen.com/Nasm">NASM</A>,
which is freely available on the Web, has many advanced commands for
defining macros and assembling multiple output formats. For simple
purposes, however, only a few commands, or <EM>pseudo-ops</EM>, are
needed:
<UL>

<LI> <TT>ORG     100h</TT><BR>

Sets the "origin'' address, the starting address for the program.  For
<TT>.COM</TT> files, this should be set to <TT>100h</TT> as shown (so this
will usually be the first statement in the source of any <TT>.COM</TT>
program).
<LI> <TT>SECTION .text</TT><BR>

Marks the start of a group of instructions to be assembled into the
executable code part of the program.
<LI> <TT>SECTION .data</TT><BR>

Marks the start of a group of declarations of initialized data.
<LI> <TT>SECTION .bss</TT><BR>

Marks the start of a group of declarations of uninitialized data.  The
<TT>SECTION</TT> commands may be interleaved in any order; when the file
is assembled, all of the <TT>.text</TT> sections will be concatenated,
followed by all of the <TT>.data</TT> and <TT>.bss</TT> sections in that
order (the <TT>.bss</TT> sections don't actually generate any code, but
the process of reserving blocks of memory causes the associated labels
to be given the correct values).
<LI> <TT>label   DB      data list</TT><BR>

Declares a block of memory initialized with the given list of data, each
datum occupying one byte.  The label becomes associated with the
starting address of the block.  Think of this as defining a variable
(with the name "label'') and giving it an initial value.  The data may
be given as numbers (default base is decimal; the suffixes '<TT>h</TT>',
'<TT>q</TT>', and '<TT>b</TT>' select hexadecimal, octal, and binary,
respectively) or character strings (surrounded by either single or
double quotes).  For example,
<PRE>
name    DB      "George", 0Dh, 0Ah ; last two characters are CR, LF
age     DB      1
</PRE>
<LI> <TT>label   DW      data list</TT><BR>

Same as <TT>DB</TT>, except each datum is stored in a 16-bit word (two successive
bytes).  This is mainly used for numeric data; the only difference it
makes to strings from using <TT>DB</TT> is that if a string has an odd
number of characters then it is padded with a final zero byte.  For
example,
<PRE>
name    DW      "George", 0Dh, 0Ah
age     DW      1
</PRE>
is equivalent to
<PRE>
name    DB      "George", 0Dh, 00h, 0Ah, 00h
age     DB      1, 0
</PRE>
(which is probably not what you want for the string).
<LI> <TT>label   RESB    size</TT><BR>

Reserves a block of memory consisting of <TT>size</TT> bytes; assign the
starting address to the label, but don't generate any output.  For
example, after the following commands, if <TT>x</TT> wound up at address
<TT>1230h</TT>, then <TT>y</TT> would start at address <TT>1238h</TT>:
<PRE>
x       RESB    8
y       RESB    4
</PRE>
The next available address in this section would be <TT>123Ch</TT>.
<LI> <TT>label   RESW    size</TT><BR>

Same as <TT>RESB</TT>, except <TT>size</TT> gives the number of two-byte
words to allocate.
<LI> <TT>label   EQU     expr</TT><BR>

Defines the label to be equal to the value of the expression.  The
expression may involve constants, other labels, and the usual range of
integer operators from C.  There are also two special constants,
<TT>$</TT> and <TT>$$</TT>.  The first, a single dollar sign, evaluates to
the current address being assembled at the beginning of the current
line.  This is useful for the following sort of calculation:
<PRE>
msg     DB      "Hello"
msglen  EQU     $ - msg
</PRE>
Since the current address at the start of the second line is the next
address after the end of the string, subtracting the address of the
start of the string will give the length of the string---in this case,
<TT>msglen</TT> will be defined as 5.  The second special constant, the
double dollar sign, evaluates to the address of the start of the current
section, so that you can check how much space you've used (with the
expression <TT>$ - $$</TT>).
