<H3>DOS Interrupts</H3>

MS-DOS provides many common services through <TT>INT 21h</TT>.  Entire
books have been written about the variety of functions available; I will
just list the most basic ones for console input and output here.
<UL>

<LI> <B>Input a character</B>.
<PRE>
        MOV     AH, 01h
        INT     21h
</PRE>
After the interrupt, AL contains the ASCII code of the input character.
The character is echoed (displayed on the screen).  Use function code 8
instead of 1 for no echo.<P>
<LI> <B>Input a string</B>.
<PRE>
        SECTION .data
Buffer  DB      BUFSIZE         ;BUFSIZE is max number of chars to read, &lt;= 255
        RESB    BUFSIZE + 1

        SECTION .text
        MOV     DX, Buffer
        MOV     AH, 0Ah
        INT     21h
</PRE>
After the interrupt, <TT>BYTE [Buffer + 1]</TT> will contain the number of
characters read, and the characters themselves will start at
<TT>Buffer + 2</TT>.  The characters will be terminated by a carriage
return (ASCII code 13), although this will not be included in the count.<P>
<LI> <B>Output a character</B>.
<PRE>
        MOV     DL, ...
        MOV     AH, 02h
        INT     21h
</PRE>
Load the desired character into DL, then call the interrupt with
function code 2 in AH.<P>
<LI> <B>Output a string</B>.
<PRE>
        MOV     DX, ...
        MOV     AH, 09h
        INT     21h
</PRE>
Load the address of a '$'-terminated string into DX, then call the
interrupt with function code 9 in AH.<P>
<LI> <B>Exit</B>.
<PRE>
        MOV     AL, ...
        MOV     AH, 4Ch
        INT     21h
</PRE>
Load the return code (0 for normal exit, non-zero for error) into AL,
then call the interrupt with function code <TT>4Ch</TT> in AH.  This is the
proper DOS exit routine; however, if you are running your program with
DEBUG, this will exit DEBUG.  An alternative is to go behind DOS's back
and use the BIOS routine accessed by <TT>INT 20h</TT>, which will return
control to the DEBUG prompt when executed.
</UL>
